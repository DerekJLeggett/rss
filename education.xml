      <title>Prepared Remarks by Secretary DeVos at the Virtual 2020 Federal Student Aid Training Conference</title>
      <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-secretary-devos-virtual-2020-federal-student-aid-training-conference</link>
      <description>Thank you, Mark, for that kind introduction and for your  reliable leadership at FSA.
Thanks, as well, to all of you—thousands of you—who join  us for this year’s conference. It’s exciting to have a record-breaking turnout,  though of course I’d much rather we all be together in person.
The FSA conference this year is like none other.  Navigating the COVID crisis has been challenging—on many fronts. And I’m  inspired by how each of you has risen to the occasion in different ways and how  you continue to put students first.</description>
