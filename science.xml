      <title>More than half of Hudson River tidal marshes were created accidentally by humans</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201218165109.htm</link>
      <description>In a new study of tidal marsh resilience to sea level rise, geologists observed that Hudson River Estuary marshes are growing upward at a rate two to three times faster than sea level rise, 'suggesting that they should be resilient to accelerated sea level rise in the future,' he says.</description>

      <description>Forest managers can now look to a newly enhanced, predictive mapping tool to learn where forests are likely to regenerate on their own and where replanting efforts may be beneficial. This study also indicates a not-so-evergreen future of fewer conifers.</description>

      <title>Land ecosystems are becoming less efficient at absorbing CO2</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201218131902.htm</link>
      <description>Land ecosystems currently play a key role in mitigating climate change. The more carbon dioxide (CO2) plants and trees absorb during photosynthesis, the process they use to make food, the less CO2 remains trapped in the atmosphere where it can cause temperatures to rise. But scientists have identified an unsettling trend - as levels of CO2 in the atmosphere increase, 86 percent of land ecosystems globally are becoming progressively less efficient at absorbing it.</description>

      <title>Monkeys, like humans, persist at tasks they've already invested in</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201218112531.htm</link>
      <description>Humans are generally reluctant to give up on something they've already committed time and effort to. It's called the 'sunk costs' phenomenon, where the more resources we sink into an endeavor, the likelier we are to continue -- even if we sense it's futile. A new study shows that both capuchin monkeys and rhesus macaques are susceptible to the same behavior and that it occurs more often when the monkeys are uncertain about the outcome.</description>

      <title>New material system to convert and generate terahertz waves developed</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201218112511.htm</link>
      <description>Terahertz light holds enormous potential for tomorrow's technologies. It might succeed 5G by enabling extremely fast mobile communications connections and wireless networks. The bottleneck in the transition from gigahertz to terahertz frequencies has been caused by insufficiently efficient sources and converters. A research team with the participation of HZDR has now developed a material system to generate terahertz pulses much more effectively than before. It is based on graphene, coated with a metallic lamellar structure.</description>

      <title>Discovery of chromophores that emit light in the ultraviolet region when excited with visible light</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201218112456.htm</link>
      <description>Fluorescence usually entails the conversion of light at shorter wavelengths to light at longer wavelengths. Scientists have now discovered a chromophore system that goes the other way around. When excited by visible light, the fluorescent dyes emit light in the ultraviolet region. According to the study, such light upconversion systems could boost the light-dependent reactions for which efficiency is important, such as solar-powered water splitting.</description>

      <description>Researchers have successfully developed technology to simulate phenomena for which the detailed mechanism or formula are unexplained. They did this by using AI to create a model, which is faithful to the laws of physics, from observational data. This technology will hopefully enable these kinds of phenomena (e.g. wave motion and fracture mechanics) to be more accurately predicted by computer simulations.</description>

      <description>New simulations carried out in part on the ATERUI II supercomputer in Japan have found that the reason ions exist at higher temperatures than electrons in space plasma is because they are better able to absorb energy from compressive turbulent fluctuations in the plasma. These finding have important implications for understanding observations of various astronomical objects such as the images of the accretion disk and shadow of the M87 supermassive black hole.</description>

      <description>Anion exchange membrane (AEM) fuel cells (AEMFCs), which produce electricity using hydrogen, are considered an alternative to currently used proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, AEMs have problems with stability in alkaline conditions, which can be overcome by crosslinking -- but effects of crosslinker length on AEMFC performance are not well understood. Now, scientists have elucidated such effects for oxygen-containing crosslinkers and, using an optimally long crosslinker, produced a novel AEMFC with greater performance.</description>

      <description>The SARS-CoV-2 virus, like many viruses before it, is bad news for the brain. In a new study, researchers found that the spike protein, often depicted as the red arms of the virus, can cross the blood-brain barrier in mice. The spike proteins alone can cause brain fog. Since the spike protein enters the brain, the virus also is likely to cross into the brain.</description>

      <description>Researchers screened drugs that can enhance the PAX6 gene and found MEK inhibitors can stimulate PAX6 expression in the eye. They tested this drug in newborn PAX6 deficient mice and found that either topical or oral administration of the drug enhanced PAX6 and partially normalized their eye development. Mice treated with topical MEK inhibitor had clearer corneas (less scarring) and could see better.</description>

      <title>Machine learning boosts the search for 'superhard' materials</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201217145229.htm</link>
      <description>Superhard materials are in high demand in industry, from energy production to aerospace, but finding suitable new materials has largely been a matter of trial and error based on classical materials such as diamonds. Now researchers have reported a machine learning model that can accurately predict the hardness of new materials, allowing scientists to more readily find compounds suitable for use in a variety of applications.</description>

      <description>Super-fast quantum computers and communication devices could revolutionize countless aspects of our lives -- but first, researchers need a fast, efficient source of the entangled pairs of photons such systems use to transmit and manipulate information. Researchers have done just that, not only creating a chip-based photon source 100 times more efficient that previously possible, but bringing massive quantum device integration within reach.</description>

      <description>Why do 2D exciton-polaritons interact? This intriguing quasiparticle, which is part light (photon), and part matter (exciton), doesn't behave as predicted: continuing to interact with other particles when confined to two dimensions in extremely cold conditions. A new study finds the answer lies in the 'light-like' characteristics of these quasiparticles, with importance for future applications such as ultra-low energy electronics.</description>

      <description>Researchers found that red squirrels in the Yukon have a greater chance of survival when living near neighbors. These fitness benefits depended on familiarity, or how long the same squirrels lived next to each other. These benefits were more pronounced in older squirrels, whom the data suggested could sharply offset the effects of aging by maintaining all of their neighbors from one year to the next.</description>

The project -- the first to use real supernovae data to inform its artificial intelligence -- is 82% accurate. Currently, scientists take spectra of 10-percent of the ~10,000 supernovae discovered each year. When the Rubin Observatory goes online, only 0.1-percent of the expected supernovae discoveries will be further studied without the new software.</description>

      <title>More West Nile virus-infected mosquitoes in lower-income areas of Baltimore</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201217135237.htm</link>
      <description>Researchers found higher rates of West Nile virus-infected mosquitoes in lower-income neighborhoods in urban areas of Baltimore, Maryland.
