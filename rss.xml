During the show's virtual panel at 2020's Comic-Con@Home, creator Michael Hirst promised a "deeply satisfying" ending. ""The characters who we all — including me — have grown to love will all have their fates decided. Whether they live or die is of course in the hands of the gods — although I had a hand in it, too." He went on to add, "I think the conclusion of the saga is deeply satisfying, a proper and meaningful ending." The world of Vikings will live on in a Netflix spin-off Vikings: Valhalla, set 100 years after the original. While they wait for the spin-off, fans can check out these shows like Vikings to sate their hunger for more action.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>30 Friends Thanksgiving Details You Totally Forgot</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[No other sitcom has captured the fun and dysfunction of Thanksgiving quite like Friends. Each of the show's 10 seasons featured a very special Turkey Day gathering, and no matter how many times you've binged the show, you'll still get a kick out of the floating heads and sisterly slap-fighting when the episodes appear in this year's TV marathon. To celebrate Friends-giving, here's a look back at some of the finer details you might have forgotton from Friends' Thanksgiving Day episodes. And if you're in the mood to watch (again), Friends is now streaming on HBO Max. ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[To prepare for his VD PSA shoot, Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) got all gussied up. We're not talking the blue lipstick incident from those Japanese Ichiban For Men commercials, mind you, but he had on enough rouge and tinted lip balm to match wits with the girls. This was all long before his stints wearing a man bag or trying on women's underwear or even that time he got his eyebrows waxed, so this was really our first brush with the fact that Joey was pretty secure in his masculinity.Episode: "The One Where Underdog Got Away."]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Considering how terrible Monica Geller (Courteney Cox)'s first Thanksgiving meal hosting experience was, it's a wonder she invited anyone over ever again. Not only did Chandler (Matthew Perry) demand his special non-Thanksgiving meal of tomato soup, grilled cheese fixin's and a family-sized bag of Funyuns, but everyone else got ridiculously picky about potatoes and proceeded to guilt trip her into serving up spuds three different ways. Phoebe was all too delighted to have forced her hand in adding peas and carrots because she pretty much skipped away from the kitchen after she was done talking about her dead mother. Poor form, Phoebes.Episode: "The One Where Underdog Got Away."]]></media:description>

So, Ross started freeversing and lyrically promised the kid a bagel and a trip to the zoo, and that's when the kid got really excited.

When she shared the idea with Phoebe, however, the gal gave her dagger eyes and said it wasn't "very Thanksgiving-y."

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for COVID-19 on Oct. 1, 2020, just one month before the presidential election. The president announced his coronavirus diagnosis on Twitter, writing, "Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!" The announcement came hours after the news that White House adviser Hope Hicks had tested positive for the virus; two days prior, Hicks had traveled with the president on Air Force One to and from the first presidential debate against former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump, who has continued to hold campaign rallies despite expert advice to practice social distancing, has come under fire in recent weeks after a recording of an interview revealed the president knew the virus was more deadly than the flu and that he deliberately downplayed it. In the debate, he claimed his rallies have not harmed Americans, saying, "So far, we have had no problem whatsoever."]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[It goes without saying that 2020 has been a year of tremendous loss. Even before coronavirus brought major devastation and claimed lives of many, the shocking accidental death of Kobe Bryant in late January started the year on a tragic note for his loved ones and fans, uniting the world in grief. The year has also seen the losses of a number of other notable and beloved stars, including Regis Philbin, Naya Rivera, civil rights leader John Lewis, Oliva de Havilland, Carl Reiner, Fred Willard, Jerry Stiller, Little Richard, actor Kenny Rogers, soul singer Bill Withers, and Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman. They are but a few of the memorable stars who died in 2020 who made us laugh, cry, and cheer throughout their careers; though they're gone, they live on through the enormous impact they made on Hollywood and the world at large. In celebration of their lives and contributions, TV Guide honors the stars we lost in 2020.]]></media:description>

Wells got her start as a beauty queen, representing Nevada in the Miss America pageant in 1959 before segueing into show business. After early roles in shows like Maverick and Bonanza, she was cast as pigtailed castaway Mary Ann Summers -- the "good girl" counterpoint to Tina Louise's sultry movie star, Ginger -- in the CBS sitcom Gilligan's Island, which ran for only three seasons in the mid 1960s but would define her career. She went on to reprise the role in a number of other shows and TV movies. Wells' other TV work included appearances on shows like Columbo, Growing Pains, Baywatch, and The Love Boat. ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[William Link, co-creator of the classic TV shows Columbo and Murder, She Wrote, died Dec. 27. He was 87. Link was best known for his prolific, decades-spanning collaboration with Richard Levinson; together, the two created Columbo and (along with Peter S.

Tenafly was one of the first shows to feature a Black protagonist, and Link and Levinson's TV movies -- including My Sweet Charlie (1970) and That Certain Summer (1972) -- were often similarly groundbreaking. The awards Link and Levinson won together include two Emmys, two Golden Globes, four Edgar Awards, the Ellery Queen Award, the Producers Guild of America Hall of Fame, and the Television Academy Hall of Fame. In 2018 Link was made Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Taylor is the man everyone in Stars Hollow loves to hate (just sometimes without that "love" part). He's domineering, rude, holier-than-thou, petty, bossy, selfish -- the list of his bad qualities is nearly endless. However, he is also the man who makes sure all of the Stars Hollow festivals go off without a hitch, so we guess Taylor isn't all bad.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Rory clearly has problems, because why she would date a trio of men who treated her badly and never give Marty a second look is seriously cuckoo bananas. Marty's smart, charming, emotionally present, pop culture savvy, and he supplied her with food -- he's everything a Gilmore girl needs in a guy!  That is, until he lied to his girlfriend, Lucy, reminding us that nobody's perfect after all.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>15. Dean Forester (Jared Padalecki)</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, he built her a car. We get it. It's romantic. But he also did the not-so romantic act of publicly humiliating Rory by dumping her in front of her friends and family -- twice! Not to mention the third time, when he broke up with her because she didn't say "I love you" fast enough. Then there's the whole cheating-on-his-wife thing and the time he married Lindsay even though he knew he was in love with Rory. But as long as our list of grievances is, we also know that, despite Dean's flaws, he had a good heart. Plus, he always treated Lorelai well.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>9. Max Medina (Scott Cohen)</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Poor Max. He was one of the few men who Rory actually looked forward to having as a stepdad. That is, before Lorelai crushed his heart. In the end, Max's perfection may have been his downfall, because it's hard for someone so reliable to keep a person's attention in the over-the-top world of Stars Hollow.]]></media:description>

And not only does Doyle love Paris for all her intense idiosyncrasies, he has more than a few of his own. But like Paris, Doyle's quirks are exactly what make him so great.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>7. Zack Van Gerbig (Todd Lowe)</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Lane was Stars Hollow's coolest resident, which means she needed a pretty cool dude. Fortunately, she found Zack, who not only shares her love of music, but is as weird as she is (remember his banjo playing and obsession with cleaning products?). It might have taken a while for Zack to process Lane having feelings for him, but afterwards, he was all-in and we're glad the pair found their happily-ever-after together.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>6. Logan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry)</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The most divisive of all of Rory's boyfriends, Logan was an entitled trust fund kid with a heart of gold. Over the course of the series, Logan helped Rory challenge herself in ways no boyfriend had done before. And in tandem, he also challenged himself to break away from his family's claustrophobic expectations and Logan matured into a thoughtful, caring, and intrepid young man. That is, until the revival completely trashed all of his character development, but we firmly stand by our decision to ignore this devolution. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>5. Jess Mariano (Milo Ventimiglia)</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The account of all the bad things Jess did is longer than Rory's reading list. He tried to force himself on her, he attempted to make her run away with him and -- oh yeah -- he moved across the country without telling her. Yet Jess is so charming, smart, and irreverent that we can't help but love the Stars Hollow bad boy. And out of all of Rory's terrible boyfriends, Jess is the one who knew her best and ultimately fulfilled his potential to become a voice of reason in the revival, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[As much as we love Seth Cohen, we can't help but wonder what would have been had Brody not left Gilmore Girls for The O.C. Dave Rygalski is not only a great name to say out loud, but a perfect human being. Dave even managed to get Mrs. Kim's stamp of approval, which is the highest accolade a love interest can get. And remember when he stayed up all night reading the entire Bible in order to take Lane to prom?]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 20 years since Gilmore Girls debuted on The WB, introducing the world to Stars Hollow and the fast-talking mother-daughter duo, Lorelai and Rory Gilmore (Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel). If you're anything like us, you've rewatched the series several times in the years since, and feel as though you know the Gilmores, Luke (Scott Patterson), Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), Lane (Keiko Agena), Paris (Liza Weil), Kirk (Sean Gunn), and the rest of the Stars Hollow bunch as well as your own family. So we decided to put this knowledge to the test with this ultimate Gilmore Girls trivia quiz. These 25 questions aren't for the casual viewer and are designed to separate the Lorelais from the Parises. (Although, let's be honest: being a Lorelai is pretty great, so this really is a win-win scenario because who needs to ace tests when you run a quaint inn and are the queen of movie nights?)But if you want to see if you're a true superfan, click ahead to see how well you know Gilmore Girls with this ultimate trivia quiz! ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The premiere of The Bachelorette Season 16 is around the corner and Clare Crawley will have her chance to find love when 31 strapping men compete for her heart. ABC has finally released the names, ages, occupations, and photos for the lucky bachelors so you can start making your picks for first impression roses, front runners, and villains early. Of course, this season will work a little differently with Tayshia Adams reportedly taking over the titular role of the show shortly into the season. So you'll have to look out for who might make a good fit for her as well! There are plenty of Blakes, Zac/Zachs, and Tylers from you to choose from, so let's meet these guys already. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>The Best Netflix Originals of 2020 So Far</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[There's no doubt that 2020 has been an arduous year. Between the never-ending spate of political headlines and the global pandemic that has put people's health and economic well-being at risk, it's no wonder folks have been turning to their televisions to give them an outlet from the real world even more than usual lately. Few things have been as comforting in these turbulent times than being able to binge series like Outer Banks, and Dead to Me.Although Netflix's productions were impacted by coronavirus shutdowns just as much as the rest of Hollywood -- we'll have to wait even longer for Stranger Things Season 4 -- the streaming service has had enough original shows and movies banked up to continue churning out new titles, month after month, and remain a major part of the cultural conversation throughout an otherwise very hectic year.Some of Netflix's new movies, shows, and specials have been better than others, of course. Here we'll walk you through some of the very best Netflix Originals of 2020, from the docuseries which no one could stop talking about (like Tiger King) to the scripted dramas that got us in our feelings (including Never Have I Ever and The Baby-Sitters Club) to the action movies that were just silly enough to let us escape for a spell (like Extraction and The Old Guard) to genuinely great comedy specials, click through to read about the best of the best on Netflix this year (so far).]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Absurd Planet</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix's Absurd Planet is not one of those boring series with monotonous voiceover that puts you to sleep, nor is it a calming doc with an Enya soundtrack that will make you dream of taking exotic vacations. Absurd Planet has evolved from WIRED's Absurd Creature column, and it highlights some of the world's weirdest creatures in some of the weirdest ways. Narrated by Mother Nature (voiced by Afi Ekulona), the show kicks things off with the dung beetle, but there are plenty more fascinating creatures within the show's 12 episodes, so if you need a good laugh and still want to watch something educational and kid-friendly, this is kind of perfect. - Kaitlin Thomas]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Afterlife Season 2</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Ricky Gervais returns for a second season of his "woe is me, Ricky Gervais" comedy-drama, playing a man trying to get his life back together after the untimely death of his wife. The problem is that he's kind of a jerk who has no problem saying the first thing that comes to his mind, which pushes people away as he deals with his grief. In Season 2, he tries to help others who helped him and says, "f--king 'ell" a lot. That's a very underrated British-ism. - Tim Surette]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Aggretsuko Season 3</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Hands down the best animated series about a red panda who does death metal karaoke at night, Aggretsuko is for everyone who harbors a dark side. The anime is more than just Sanrio cuteness overload, though. With storylines about aggressive male bosses and hostile work environments, it's actually a sharp satire of a male-dominated industry with a strong female character. - Tim Surette]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Altered Carbon Season 2</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[After a nearly two-year break, this extravagant sci-fi show returned for its second season. The cyberpunk adaptation mostly sticks with the same hyperviolent detective-story-with-complicated-sci-fi-stuff format from Season 1, but Anthony Mackie takes over the role of Takeshi Kovacs from Joel Kinnaman, because in Altered Carbon consciousnesses can be uploaded into different bodies. (He's still played in flashbacks by Will Yun Lee.)  - Liam Mathews]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[This powerful documentary follows the two-year investigation by reporters from The Indianapolis Star who uncovered one of the greatest sports scandals in history: the abuse of hundreds of gymnasts at the hands of doctor Larry Nassar. Athlete A is a reference to Maggie Nichols, who first brought complaints about Nassar to USA Gymnastics in 2015. The film is about a program rotten to its core, the sacrifice of young athletes to uphold an image, and the brave survivors who came forward. - Tim Surette]]></media:description>

Jason Katims' (Friday Night Lights, Parenthood) latest follows Swank's astronaut and her diverse crew on the first manned mission to Mars as they confront issues of loneliness and family drama as their loved ones are left back home.

It would be Beastars, a twisted and fascinating Netflix anime about a world filled with animals living as humans and under a treaty that dictates predators don't eat prey... until an alpaca is brutally murdered by someone who can longer resist his carnivorous urges. A wolf takes it upon himself to solve the murder, and befriends a cute little rabbit along the way. Feeling emerge, but are they romantic or something more sinister?

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Prolific producer Kenya Barris -- best known for creating the great ABC sitcom black-ish -- chafed at the restrictions placed on him at Disney-owned ABC Studios, so he left for Netflix. Now he's back with a black-ish-ish comedy series called #blackAF, which you know is edgier because it has an implied swear in the title. Like black-ish, it's semi-autobiographical, but even more so, as Barris plays a fictionalized version of himself, showing what Hollywood and parenthood is like for a superrich black family. Rashida Jones plays his wife, Joya, and she too probably has a pretty similar life to the character, except her real life has more Vampire Weekend. - Liam Mathews]]></media:description>

This may be the least funny season of BoJack, but it's also the most bingeable. Suspense, drama, and the sense of inevitable doom make it tough to see but impossible not to watch. - Brian Patchett]]></media:description>

Once again, the object here is to kill Dracula, who goes on a rampage against humans after his wife is burned at the stake. Monster hunter Trevor Belmont takes up the task with the help of a few friends. Castlevania is primarily a horror series, featuring some visceral gore and gratuitous sex.

The second season is once again loaded with twists, but they're darker than ever before as Dead to Me approaches Ozark-levels of manipulation and panic.

It is frightening, sad, and also very funny. So many filmmakers not named Joel and Ethan Coen try to mix up distinct storytelling styles and invariably fail. Jeff Baena does not. Then there's Alison Brie's performance. She is enormously charismatic, and watching this film is a real workout on your emotions.

It's about a woman (the great Jessie Buckley) who despite planning to break up with her boyfriend (the great Jesse Plemons) goes on a trip to meet his parents (the great David Thewlis and the great Toni Collette) at their isolated farm. Once they're there, things start going very wrong. Like impossibly, existentially, seeing-beyond-the-veil wrong. This movie will be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the next Oscars and it won't win because it's too weird. Or maybe it'll be too weird to even earn a nomination.

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Here's another fact: Improv is for dweebs. Mostly. In the hands of masters, improv is an astonishing feat of quick-thinking, crisis-management, and spontaneous choreography, and Silicon Valley's Thomas Middleditch and Parks and Recreation's Ben Schwartz are pretty damn great at improv. The three-episode comedy special Middleditch &#38; Schwartz were taped during their recent improv tour, where they take the stage with a couple of chairs, talk with an audience member to get a set-up, and then make everything up on the spot while playing dozens of different characters inside a single story. There are moments when you'll swear they're in some sort of harmonious mind meld, and then there are other times when they seemingly go out of their way to sabotage each other for laughs. - Tim Surette]]></media:description>

This one is about topics like embracing his 50s and finding love again. That's right; the guy who has a famous bit about how his text message autofill assumes he's typing "I hate" is trying out a positive mental attitude. And this special has a pretty novel gimmick: a post-credits sequence that's another hour-long special entirely, from comic Bob Rubin, presented by Oswalt. - Liam Mathews]]></media:description>

        <media:title>The Platform</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The Platform centers on a prison-like system in which each day's food buffet, which is meant to be enough for everyone in the unit, is passed down from one level to the next, and the occupants of the lower levels are often left with nothing to eat thanks to the greed of those on the higher levels. The Spanish-language dystopian thriller from Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia is not a movie for the faint of heart (nor those with uneasy stomachs); in addition to being extremely gory, the film is also deeply unsettling for its imagery of the food that gets passed down from one level to the next in increasingly slimmer and more disgusting portions. The concept of the movie is what makes it a standout addition to the Netflix library, though, as it becomes a scathing, but captivating rebuke of capitalism ... if you can finish it, at least.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix recently released a list of its 10 most popular original movies as measured by number of views in their first four weeks of release, and four of the top five were action movies, with The Old Guard rapidly ascending (it's definitely already bumped Murder Mystery from the top five since the list was published). Project Power will almost certainly also make the list, because it has the same formula as all the other hit Netflix action movies. It's familiar, but original enough. It's not based on any existing property, but it feels like it could be. It's set in New Orleans, where a pill available on the streets either gives people superpowers for five minutes at a time or kills them. Jamie Foxx stars as a guy trying to get his daughter back because her lifeforce is being harvested for the pills. He's helped by a cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and a teenage dealer (The Deuce's Dominique Fishback). - Liam Mathews]]></media:description>

You would have to wake up every day feeling like Allen Iverson in 2001 to even consider making a prequel series to the 1962 novel/1975 movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest -- one of the most acclaimed movies ever made — focusing on the character of Nurse Ratched, let alone doing it in a totally different tone and style from the movie, changing from a straightforward drama to a psychological thriller. But Murphy only puts up big shots, and this one stars his frequent collaborator Sarah Paulson in a colorful period piece set in 1947 that tells the cruel nurse's origin story. Ratched's all-star cast also includes Vincent D'Onofrio, Sharon Stone, and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon. – Liam Mathews]]></media:description>

She even borrows "goofy," his signature adjective. She updates his style for 2020, though, replacing his misogyny with hilariously independent-minded takes on the racism of white male confidence, the failures of #MeToo, the reason she doesn't like Greta Thunberg, and how her girlfriend forgets that just because she's masculine-presenting, she's still a woman. She may be influenced by Patrice O'Neal, but her point of view is completely her own. - Liam Mathews]]></media:description>

It's their first movie for Netflix and the first movie they've made together that's supposed to be purely fun. (Deepwater Horizon wasn't a barrel of laughs, you know?) Wahlberg plays Spenser, a former Boston detective who went to prison after being framed by crooked cops he was trying to expose. Now he's out, and he teams up with his hulking new friend Hawk (Black Panther's Winston Duke) to bring the perps to justice. The movie is very loosely based on the Spenser &#38; Hawk characters created by legendary crime novelist Robert B. Parker, not keeping much beyond the names and Boston setting.

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[You may think you know Taylor Swift just because you have spy cameras set up all over her house and you're perched in a tree stand with high-powered binoculars staring into her bedroom right now, but you don't really know her at all. This Taylor-approved documentary gives you a better look into her life as a put-upon pop star wrestling with being the voice of a small army and being true to herself even if it means alienating part of her audience. It's a bit polished and likely staged, but there are some fascinating real moments in there, too. - Tim Surette]]></media:description>

His story was almost too bizarre to be true, and yet it absolutely was. From start to finish, this gripping behind-the-scenes account drew viewers into the warped world of big cat zoos and the deadly feud that landed the Tiger King behind bars.]]></media:description>

An emotional and funny tale about multiple generations, Tigertail follows a young man's decision to leave behind the homeland he loves to start a new life in the U.S. with a woman he barely knows, and fast-forwards to the future as the man realizes that his adult American-born daughter, who he also feels little connection with, is showing the same stubbornness he did.

Lana Condor is back as adorable everygirl Lara Jean Covey, who's happily dating dreamboat Peter Kavinsky (breakout star Noah Centineo) now that their pretend relationship from the first movie has evolved to become real. But when the recipient of one of her other letters -- John Ambrose McClaren, played by Dancing with the Stars' Jordan Fisher -- reenters her life, she's caught in a conundrum: Can she love two boys at once?

And these young folks have a really, really hard time with it. They have to look within and find a spiritual solution for the emptiness they feel. Not all holes can be filled physically. A YouTube commenter on the trailer described this as "basically Love Island but Amazon's Alexa is controlling everything," which is incredibly on point. - Liam Mathews]]></media:description>

As adults, they're reunited when their father dies, putting in motion a series of events that will eventually bring on the apocalypse. One of the best things about The Umbrella Academy is that it points out some super problematic superhero tropes. "What would happen if an eccentric billionaire raised superpowered children in an isolated training environment and weaponized their abilities? They all be super f---ed up, that's what!" - Tim Surette]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[No more than 90 seconds into Uncorked and I wasn't sure what I craved more, some nicely charred rib tips or a glass of a jammy Châteauneuf-du-Pape. The cooking and preparation of mouthwatering Memphis-style BBQ and the vine-to-vintage route of a fine wine are lustily photographed in a dazzling opening credits sequence. This new Netflix original (which was to have debuted at SXSW before the festival was closed thanks to the coronavirus pandemic) is a fairly straightforward "a man must choose his own path" story, but it's the specifics that set it apart. And the specifics, in this case, are delicious. - Jordan Hoffman]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix is obsessed with the idea of interactive TV (see: Black Mirror's Bandersnatch, Bear Gryll's You vs. Wild, and some kids' stuff), and is applying state-of-the-art button pressing to a special episode of its comedy series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. You get to choose if Kimmy and Tituss walk or take an Uber! And so forth. This will either work great, go terribly, or fall somewhere in the middle. As for the episode's actual plot, Kimmy discovers that there might be another bunker full of women, so she tries to save them just days before her wedding. - Tim Surette]]></media:description>

In the decade the show's been away, the rules of true crime TV have changed, and the new version has higher production value and a greater focus on character as ordinary people try to figure out what this extraordinary event that happened to them or their loved one was. The reboot comes from the creators of the original docuseries, Cosgrove/Meurer Productions, and 21 Laps Entertainment, the producers of Stranger Things. - Liam Mathews]]></media:description>

A woman from Manchester goes to Ibiza to investigate the disappearance of her brother, a DJ, from the party island 20 years earlier. Brits-doing-crime-in-Spain reminds me of the classic movie Sexy Beast, but that's not necessarily the vibe of this series. It's wildly excessive and fun, though. - Liam Mathews]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Warrior Nun</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The comic book-based series is set in Spain (which means it's gorgeous) and stars Alba Baptista as Ava, a young woman and former quadriplegic who is given a second chance at life -- and the use of her arms and legs! -- when an angel's halo embedded in her back revives her from the dead and gifts her with special powers. As Ava attempts to come to terms with what's happened to her and explore her newfound freedom, she also finds out she is part of an elite and secret order of nuns tasked with tracking down and killing demons on Earth. Fans of Buffy will recognize a number of parallels in the 10-episode first season, which subverts expectations and features a confident Chosen One who refuses to bend to anyone's will, including that of the Catholic Church. The show might have one of the wildest premises we've ever heard, but it's the perfect escape in these trying times. - Kaitlin Thomas]]></media:description>

"She enjoys him the way the audience enjoys him," Rhea Seehorn said of Kim. "I mean, she finds him frightening and scary sometimes, but they've seen Breaking Bad. Kim has not seen Breaking Bad, thank god. ... So she's a really good conduit for the audience seeing him in fun but also more complex ways."Read the full cover story...]]></media:description>

"The audience was there, going, 'We trust it. We know there's going to be a reward. Everything I'm watching is going to have meaning.'"]]></media:description>

"Yes, it's fun doing the explosive crazy scenes, and they're great storytelling, but when they let us do the really quiet small stuff, and we have to just listen, and things can change on a dime because of the way somebody said something, that is when I feel the most authentic threads of the relationship."]]></media:description>

"He loves scenes where he's in a dumpster, or he's out in the desert and his clothes are falling apart and his shoes are falling apart. Somehow when he has those moments, you start seeing what the character is made of." ]]></media:description>

When young Kim was shown with the instrument on her back, Seehorn asked writer Tom Schnauz for answers. "They liked specifically that she looks even smaller next to a cello, that it makes her even tinier in the picture," Seehorn said. "So that made sense. I don't know if I'm supposed ever play the cello on the show, because if so, I'm going to take a lot of lessons. I do not play cello."]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[When Peter Gould and Vince Gilligan first approached Bob Odenkirk about a Saul Goodman spin-off, Odenkirk gave them his trust. "The only thing I had to say about that was that you're going to have to make him likable. They both agreed immediately that the Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad was fun to watch, but not because he was inherently a good, likable person you want to be with," Odenkirk said. "You can watch him like you watch a car wreck. You can't turn away. But you don't really cheer for him. So they had to figure that one out, and they did. They invented who he was when he wasn't Saul Goodman, and that was a likable guy who was trying to figure out his place in the world."]]></media:description>

"Kim loves doing that. Why she does, and if there's something more to say about her past, is something that we're still mulling over.

        <media:title>The Best Grey's Anatomy Doctors of All Time, Ranked</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[An eclectic assortment of doctors appeared on Grey's Anatomy throughout the course of its 16 seasons so far. Where would the ABC drama be without Ellen Pompeo, an emotional alchemist who can twist, bend, and manipulate our feelings to her will? Or Chandra Wilson's fearsome but lovable Miranda Bailey, who commands the screen as much as she does the interns?From ambitious know-it-alls like Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) to heartbreakers — hey there, Karev (Justin Chambers) — to bad boys with gooey centers like the late, great McSteamy, aka Mark Sloane (Eric Dane), there's never a dull moment at Grey Sloan. Each week is a tantalizing affair as these ridiculously good-looking pros in white coats juggle hair-raising medical mishaps with secret closet hookups, tumultuous breakups, and more drama than a Lifetime movie marathon. With plenty of names to choose from, we're highlighting the most unforgettable medical professionals who've made Shonda Rhimes' groundbreaking medical drama must-see TV for 363 episodes and counting. Here are the 52 best Grey's Anatomy's doctors, ranked.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>52. Robert Stark (Peter MacNicol)</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Not to be overly dramatic, but this guy was the worst. Stepping in to replace Arizona Robbins, who went to Malawi, he rubbed pretty much everyone the wrong way with his sheer laziness and penchant for taking credit for others' work. It's not that Stark was incompetent, per se, but he was more concerned with being right than helping his patients, and as a result, he often clashed with his co-workers and resorted to unnecessarily extreme measures in the OR rather than listening to better suggestions.]]></media:description>

But she's probably most remembered for being murdered by Gary Clark, who was looking for Derek. We can never unsee the startling image of April slipping on her blood and discovering the body.]]></media:description>

Her transfer to Grey Sloan was met with coldness from Meredith, but after initially giving Penny a hard time, Meredith learned to forgive her. Despite Penny eventually getting along with most of the doctors, fans still hold a grudge due to her role in Derek's death, as well as forcing Callie to move all the way to New York, only to have them ultimately break up.]]></media:description>

His time at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital was cut short when grieving widower Gary Clark shot him while looking for Derek, Richard, and Lexie. For a moment, it looked like he could have been saved, but a nonworking elevator prevented him from getting the proper care he needed to survive. His final moments with Bailey, in which he asked her to tell Reed he loved her, hit especially hard considering Reed had already been killed. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>25. Nicole Herman (Geena Davis)</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[We hope to have a fraction of the fortitude Dr. Herman showed when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. After coming to terms with dying, she was convinced by Arizona and Amelia to undergo surgery to remove it, which left her completely blind. But the resilient doctor bounced back by hooking up with Koracick and declaring blind sex the best sex. A legend. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>24. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd)</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The great thing about Owen is that he has a big heart. The frustrating thing about Owen is that he doesn't always know what his heart wants. His relationships with Cristina and Amelia crashed and burned in spectacular fashion. In Season 16, it looked like he was finally settling into a sense of normalcy with Teddy and their newborn child, and they planned an at-home wedding. But after overhearing Teddy having an affair with Tom Koracick via a butt dial, Owen made up an excuse to skip their nuptials.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Easily one of the show's most divisive characters, April was a woman of principle who lacked a filter, a trait that often rubbed others the wrong way. Despite a rocky tenure -- which included a tumultuous relationship with Jackson and a crisis of faith -- she found her happily-ever-after when she married her ex-fiancé, Matthew, in the Season 14 finale.]]></media:description>

Her journey to get to a point in her life where she can have the career, the guy, the family, and the friends took many dramatic twists and turns, and that doesn't seem to be letting up anytime soon. From a frustrating back-and-forth with Owen to a fling with Mark to a surprise pregnancy and now an affair, things are never simple for Teddy. But her fierceness in the OR helped shape medical greats like Cristina Yang, which is quite a nice thing to add to anyone's resumé.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>19. Tom Koracick (Greg Germann)</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Behind the unmitigated arrogance and biting one-liners is a decent guy capable of caring about someone other than himself. Tom's best moments are often unexpected, like when he was visibly shaking during Catherine's surgery before quickly pulling it together. He might be an export at putting up a front, but he can also be pretty great when he actually lets his guard down -- and when he isn't having an affair with an engaged woman. ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[There's a reason they call him the Ortho God, and it's not just his swoon-worthy good looks. His charming personality has us pulling for him to enjoy a happy new beginning with Amelia and their newborn son. A good guy with a heart of gold -- he even cut off his hair to match a patient with the same childhood cancer -- Link is more than meets the eye, and one of our favorite newer additions to the series. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>17. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl)</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Izzie's legacy is haunted by that bizarre ghost sex scene with Denny in Season 5, which unfortunately overshadows the other wonderful things she did on the show. A dedicated friend who always fought tooth-and-nail for her patients, Izzie had a big heart and brought a special warmth to the show that we still miss all these years later. In Season 16, we learned —via a letter from Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) — that she and Alex have twin children, and that the pair had rekindled their romance. While we're happy to see Alex and Izzie build a new life together in Kansas, we hate that it was done at Jo's expense.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>16. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams)</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[There's an unwritten rule that doctors must be ridiculously good-looking on Grey's, and this cerebral hunk certainly fits the mold. Self-assured, almost to a fault, Jackson has had quite the journey since popping up in Season 6, as he's slowly learned that he doesn't have all the answers. After a string of failed relationships, the latest being Maggie and Station 19's Vic (Barrett Doss), we're pulling for him to find a love that lasts. ]]></media:description>

Beyond that, she's also awkward, sweet, and one of the most capable people you'll ever see walk Grey Sloan's halls. Unapologetically rocking her natural curls while commanding the OR, this melanated diva is a true gem. As her story has progressed, we've enjoyed her slow transition from an emotionally closed-off person to someone who's much more open about her feelings.]]></media:description>

That's how we feel when we look at George, one of the sweetest guys who ever worked at Seattle Grace. This human puppy may have been immensely unlucky in love -- remember that time he got syphilis or when Meredith cried while they were having sex? -- but he remains beloved all these years after his shocking death in Season 5.

We cheered when Izzie went off on him for posting her lingerie photos all over the hospital walls, and we groaned when he made off-color comments to patients. But as the show evolved, so did Alex, who transitioned from disgusting frat bro to one of our most beloved characters. The Alex we know now is leagues ahead of the insensitive jerk we met way back in Season 1, and the journey to get there was amazing to watch. Yes, his exit was rushed (and crazy), but that doesn't change the impact he left on the hospital.]]></media:description>

However, this passionate hunk does come with a few flaws. He can be headstrong and impulsive, but he also knows what he wants and goes after it without hesitation. Both emotionally intense and incredibly gentle, he's the right man for Meredith -- when he doesn't let that stubborn attitude get in the way. He's going through a rough patch now, but we're hopeful he'll return to being the caring and charismatic DeLuca we know and love.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Amelia's journey on Grey's has been a rocky one, to say the least. She brought the drama with impulsive decisions like ditching her fiancé to move to Seattle and hooking up with Mark Sloan. Plus, her horrendous treatment of Owen and a god complex in the OR easily made her one of the show's most disliked characters for a while. But we learned to understand her more in Season 14 when it was revealed that a tumor was behind her prior antics. Since then, she's made a complete turnaround and become one of the more likable figures on the show. And she's finally found happiness in a sweet romance with Link, which resulted in the birth of their son. ]]></media:description>

However, if you had asked us after his first appearance in Season 2, we never would have expected to like Seattle's resident bad boy, let alone love him. After all, Mark slept with his best friend's wife and then hit on Meredith the second he strolled through those hospital doors. But the thing about Mark is that there's so much more to him than funny quips and an active sex life. Underneath the innuendo and brazen confidence is a sensitive guy who just wants to be loved, which is why we cheered for him and Lexie to make it work together and crumbled into a million pieces when they both died after the Season 8 plane crash.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>6. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh)</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The odds were stacked against Addison, who came into Grey's as Derek's wife and a romantic foil for Meredith. However, we couldn't help but enjoy her crackling wit, respect her bold honesty, and understand her desire to make her marriage to Derek work. A passionate and skilled surgeon who deservedly secured her own spin-off, Private Practice, Addison brought an exciting new dynamic to Seattle Grace and left a permanent imprint on our hearts.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>5. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey)</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Before McSteamy, it was McDreamy who sent hearts aflutter with his wavy locks, perfect smile, brooding demeanor, and undeniable charm. There aren't enough words in the dictionary to describe how we feel about the brilliant neurosurgeon who earned the respect of his peers and the adoration of pretty much anyone who came in his vicinity. More than just a top surgeon, Derek was a genuinely great guy and part of an epic romance that will go down as one of the best in TV history. Meredith has always deserved the world, and we're grateful for everything Derek brought into her life in the abbreviated time they had together.]]></media:description>

Sure, Cristina lacked a certain tact in sensitive situations, but she was also kind, loving, and deeply loyal -- just look at her iconic friendship with Meredith and rollercoaster romance with Preston.

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[If we're being honest, Grey Sloan would have fallen apart long ago had it not been for Bailey. Holding it down during the worst of the worst, Bailey is the show's true backbone. While she appears tough and stubborn at first impression, she can also be vulnerable and compassionate if you give her the chance to show it.]]></media:description>

Brilliant, brave, vulnerable, resilient and compassionate, Meredith Grey is the glue that holds everything together, and we couldn't imagine the Shondaland drama without her. Surviving everything from a bomb scare to the death of her husband, and almost losing her medical license in an effort to help an uninsured patient, she's every bit as heroic as the spandex supers on The CW, and we'll always root for her and for her happiness.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Meet the New Singles of the Love Island USA Season 2 Cast</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[It's time to meet the new singles of Love Island USA Season 2! There are 11 Islanders who will be looking for love when the new season premieres on Monday, Aug. 24 at 8/7c on CBS, and based on what we already know about them, it's shaping up to be quite the season.From Connor, the "brainy" auditor who has apparently been working on his dancing during quarantine, to Justine, whose ideal partner is "tall" but also "humble and respectful," it's immediately clear there's a lot of personality happening on the Season 2 island. There are also four Geminis in this cast, and we'll leave you to do with that information what you will.This season's location has shifted from Fiji to Las Vegas, and there will be a ton of safety guidelines in place, including quarantining cast and crew in "bubbles," and conducting regular COVID-19 testing throughout the season, in addition to daily symptoms screenings. While this season is going to look a bit different for very obvious reasons (it was originally supposed to premiere in May but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic), nothing can ever really stop Love Island USA.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The Masked Singer has been both a bona fide hit for Fox and a really good time; either in spite of or because of a constant barrage of terrible news, watching celebrities, including Chris Daughtry, Jesse McCartney, Joey Fatone and many more, on the show week after week has been a source of real joy for three seasons. As much fun as it's been to watch the heads get yanked off and marvel at the gorgeous costumes, it's sometimes easy to forget The Masked Singer is indeed a singing competition -- and some of the competitors are truly outstanding. While we await what's to come in The Masked Singer Season 4, let's take a look back at the best performances, and suss out which performance is the best of all time so far. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>The 100 Cast Then and Now</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[It feels like just yesterday we were watching the pilot episode of The CW's sci-fi series The 100, as a group of seriously underprepared juvenile delinquents were sent from space down to a radioactive Earth. Now, here we are seven seasons later watching fully-grown adults face bigger and badder obstacles all across the galaxy! We can't help but get emotional when reminiscing about all the ways Clarke (Eliza Taylor), Bellamy (Bob Morley), Octavia (Marie Avgeropoulos), and the rest of the gang have grown and changed over the years, which is probably why we made this "Then and Now" gallery. And yes, we've thrown in the rest of the cast's first appearances -- from Lindsey Morgan's early in Season 1 all the way to newbies like Lola Flanery who have only joined recently.From their first appearances on the show to their Season 7 debuts, take a trip down memory lane and scroll through these photos of The 100 cast then and now!]]></media:description>

        <media:title>The 50 Best Episodes of The Office</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The Office is always open. Since ending its 2005-2013, Emmy-winning run on NBC, the workplace comedy, starring Steve Carell, Jenna Fischer, John Krasinski, and Rainn Wilson, has become a binge-watch favorite, and for good reason. Over the course of its nine seasons and 201 episodes, The Office gave us plenty of laughs, instantly quotable moments, and characters we'll never forget. Who among us hasn't made a Jim face at a non-existent camera, or replaced the words to a song with Michael's parody lyrics? There's no denying The Office has made a huge mark on our culture, but which episode of the classic sitcom is the all-time best episode of The Office? Don't worry, we attempted to settle the debate.Click ahead to see TV Guide's picks for the 50 best Office episodes, ranked from really good to the absolute greatest.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Over the course of Friends' 10 seasons at NBC, there were a lot of epic guest star appearances, including some actors who've become even more famous than the Central Perk crew.It wasn't all fun and water balloon fights when it came to these supporting characters, though. There were some recurring and even one-off characters that did nothing but grind on all the nerves -- no disrespect to the actors portraying them, of course. Click through to see who we hated the most as you revisit the celebrated comedy, which is now streaming on HBO Max.]]></media:description>

As much as Phoebe's own dating history could read like a "Who's Who of Human Crap" -- lookin' at you, Rog -- Parker and all his ultra-sunny takes were much too much, and, yeah, he had to go.

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The runner-up for Miss Oklahoma, Wendy (Selma Blair) was a hot mess, and she knew it. Although Chandler should've probably picked up all the signals she was throwing down earlier than he did, Chandler's always been clueless so we'll have to let it slide. Between all her ham-stealing and adultery, though, Wendy knew exactly what she was doing, and ughh. Stop.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[You pretty much can't judge a laboring mom-to-be for anything, but somehow, Doreen (Debi Mazar)'s behavior still crossed that line and became too intolerable to take. Between slinging insults at everyone in the room at any given time and defending her pervy husband for sneaking a peek at Rachel in a delicate state, this was not a pleasant person at all. Nah uh.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Greg Kinnear as Dr. Benjamin Hobart</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Charlie certainly deserves some demerits for hopping right back into his arms as soon as the water was warm, without any warning to Ross (whom she hooked up while still with Joey, but nevermind that). But Dr. Hobart (Greg Kinnear) used his position of academic authority to punish Ross for a personal rift, which is even worse than when Ross decided it was a smartguy move to hook up with a student at his university.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Brad Pitt as Will</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[There was something very satisfying to the pop culture world about seeing Brad Pitt guest star on Jennifer Aniston's show because they were tabloid sweethearts at the time for sure, but his character was kinda the worst. Here's a guy who can't keep it together for the length of one freaking meal that he's an unexpected guest at and who also does his former best friend the disservice of ratting on his bad behavior of old in front of his baby mama-to-be. How mature.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>David Arquette as Malcolm</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[He wasn't the only one of Ursula's castaways that Phoebe would take a shine to, but there was almost nothing redeemable about Malcolm (David Arquette). He was dense, obsessive, and duplicitous. As Joey might say, Phoebe sure does pick "some stinkers."]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Jennifer Coolidge as Amanda</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Contrary to Chandler's opinion, Amanda (Jennifer Coolidge) absolutely could not dance, and that was the least worst thing about her. Her utter fakery and intolerable boastfulness made her ripe for the friend removal list, and Monica and Phoebe were right to cut her out of their lives long ago.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Reese Witherspoon as Jill</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[As ditzy and materialistic as Rachel was when she first broke things off with Barry, she at least had a sensitive side to speak of. Not so for her little sister Jill (Reese Witherspoon), who was so self-absorbed and unkind that she made a point of trying to seduce Ross just for the sake of making her own flesh and blood sister miserable... remembering that this is the thanks Rachel got for trying to help her sister come out of her stuck-up spoiled girl coma, yeah, it's pretty bad.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[She might've been cool enough to watch midnight Ernie Kovacs specials and hang out in a hockey jersey in the living room canoe, but Kathy (Paget Brewster) was a pretty messed up individual in the end. After Chandler accused her of sleeping with her co-star behind his back, she went and did just that because reasons.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Christina Applegate as Amy</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The other Green sister to come into the picture was somehow even worse than the rest. Amy (Christina Applegate) was a total scene-stealer, yes, but she was also gnawingly ridiculous, with all her pompous dismissals of literally everything in Rachel's life -- including her daughter, which is, to quote Ross, simply "too far." And the way she bludgeoned Monica's wedding china? Rude doesn't begin to describe it.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Ben Stiller as Tommy</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[This dude was legitimately like a cartoon. Long before Ben Stiller would star alongside Jennifer Aniston in Along Came Polly, he portrayed her veryyyy temporary love interest Tommy, who had quite the attitude problem. Somehow, he only lifted the veil on his intense rage in front of Ross, but once everyone got a good look at the real Tommy -- bursting into hysterics over the group's beloved birds, no less -- his time on the show was mercifully over.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Suzie Moss (Julia Roberts) held a grudge for an offense that happened all the way back in second grade, and it was not OK. After a chance run-in with Chandler, she decided to seduce him into wearing her thong panties so that she could ditch him and steal his clothes, leaving him to wander the chilly streets of New York in his knickers just because of something his 7-year-old self did. What a gal.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Jon Lovitz as Steve</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[There are not one but two terrible appearances by Steve (Jon Lovitz). In the first, the erstwhile restaurant owner got high on the way to Monica's audition for his chef job and wasted her time, precious little remaining money, and energy all the while. Not cool, Steve. Then, years later, he was set up with Rachel on a blind date, and while she didn't seem to remember him from before, she was definitely not impressed by his lack of accomplishments, self-disdain, and openness about his many, many issues. ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Phoebe might've started to be charmed by Eddie (Adam Goldberg) at the height of his mania, but everyone else was rightly freaked out. It's not quite clear what's ailing this guy, but it's clear he needed some extensive treatment for all his imagined conversations and paranoia over Chandler's relationships with his ex-girlfriend Tilly and his fish, real and fake. The resulting reactions from his very temporary roomie might've been hilarious, but when he finally got the boot, it was nothing but a relief.]]></media:description>

On top of that, he was also a hypocrite -- telling his daughters horror stories about smoking but still hitting the hallway to have a puff himself, e.g. -- put his kids in the middle of his messy divorce, and made fast enemies with Ross for absolutely no reason.]]></media:description>

He had every right to rat on Ross for dating his daughter, so why didn't he just go and do it if he cared so much?

        <media:title>Maggie Wheeler as Janice</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[You might say "Oh my God" for us including Janice (Maggie Wheeler) here, but, yes, she was problematic, too. Consider the fact that she hooked up with her ex-husband twice while dating Chandler -- not long after she said Chandler seeing someone else would make him "the biggest jerk on the planet," mind you. And then think about when she told Rachel that Ross would ditch her for "little miss new boobs" and go full-on deadbeat dad just because they weren't married. Not a very modern way of thinking, Janice! And let's not forget the time she almost moved in next door to Chandler and Monica just to lean into the awkward tension. Janice was funny and sweet sometimes, but she also had that nails-on-a-chalkboard effect at times, too. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>TV Shows That Went From Good to Great in Season 2</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that some TV shows, even good ones, can lose their luster after the first season. It's commonplace for a series to come out swinging, earn a renewal, and then not be able to recapture the magic that made them interesting in the first place. On the other hand, there are also quite a few series which enjoyed the opposite effect, starting out fine enough but then blowing everyone away with the follow-up run.When it comes to the shows in this gallery, they were all more than decent at the outset but became fully realized and incredible additions to this Peak TV landscape in their second years.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>30 Rock</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[While Season 1's "Tracy Does Conan" is often thought of as 30 Rock's first great episode, Season 2 is when Tina Fey and Robert Carlock's workplace comedy came into its own. In its second go-around, 30 Rock was more self-assured and character-driven, embracing the bizarre humor it became known for. Season 2 laid the groundwork for themes that recurred through the end of the series, like Liz's (Fey) ham-fisted attempts at having it all (in one episode, she stuffs a sandwich into her mouth at TSA check while trying to catch up with her ex-boyfriend) and Jack's (Alec Baldwin) career crisis. It's rare to look at a season of TV and think, "Wow, every single episode is good," but that's just the way it is: Thanks to the 2007-2008 writers' strike, 30 Rock had a shortened season, meaning they had to make every moment count. And, by the hammer of Thor, they did. - Allison Picurro]]></media:description>

        <media:title>The 100</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[We'll be the first to admit that The 100 took a minute to find its footing, but by the end of Season 1, it was a solid show. Then, in Season 2, everything just seemed to click for some reason! The stakes were higher than ever, the storytelling moved at a breakneck pace, and it became impossible not to watch this show every week. Most of that can be attributed to spending more time on world-building, creating a vivid (and sometimes incredibly dark) picture that grabbed the audience and didn't let go. - Lindsay MacDonald]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Alias</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Alias had an excellent premise from the jump (don't even get us started on how excellent this show's pilot episode was), and Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) instantly became an iconic female lead. It's hard to pick out exactly what made Season 2 so amazing, but we'd definitely start with the addition of Sydney's mother, as well as the takedown of SD-6 and the Alliance. While Alias, unfortunately, became one of those series where you couldn't miss an episode without being totally lost, it also ensured you'd rather cut off your own limbs than miss an hour of this show. - Lindsay MacDonald]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Black Mirror</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Black Mirror's second season is only three episodes long (gotta love British TV!) but it starts off strong with one of the strongest episodes of the show's history, "Be Right Back," about a woman who creates an android version of her deceased boyfriend. That would almost be enough to solidify it as a perfect season of television, but with the unforgettably tense "White Bear" and the cautionary tale that is "The Waldo Moment," the anthology series allowed itself to double down on what it's best at: exploring the intersection of humanity and technology. - Allison Picurro]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Community</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[If Community's first season established what the comedy was setting out to do, Season 2 leaned into its most delightfully bizarre sensibilities. Every episode sought out to heighten what was done in the one before -- in one, the characters accidentally create a mini zombie apocalypse; in another, a Pulp Fiction spoof becomes a My Dinner with Andre reboot. It brought lightning-fast jokes, endless pop culture references, and pulled off ambitious plots without sacrificing character development. Its two-part paintball-themed season finale should earn it a place on the TV hall of fame forever. - Allison Picurro]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Fleabag</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The first season of Fleabag was a rousing adaptation of Phoebe Waller-Bridge's celebrated one-woman show, with a few bonus elements like the penis wall she just had to keep and her mastery of fourth wall-breaking. But the second season was a masterpiece right from the start, with a premiere that introduced the world to Andrew Scott's deliciously sinful Hot Priest. It got all of the key players together for a dinner sequence that set a thrilling tone for the series' second (and final) bow. From there, the season was laser focused on filling its precious few episodes with laugh-out-loud hilarity, clever symbolism, and one wonderfully messy love story. There's a reason Hollywood threw all the trophies at Waller-Bridge for Season 2: it was perfection. - Amanda Bell]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Grey's Anatomy</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Grey's Anatomy was a bonafide hit from its very first episode. Those first few episodes introduced us to Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), McDreamy (Patrick Dempsey) and an intern class that has yet to be matched. It created a great foundation for what was to come, but it was the show's second season that cemented Grey's Anatomy in the pop culture zeitgeist. The second season took the first season's drama and made gold. Season 2 is where we got Meredith's now legendary "Pick Me. Choose Me. Love Me," speech. Season 2 is when George (T.R. Knight) coached Bailey (Chandra Wilson) through giving birth to Tuck. Season 2 is when we first met Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). Most importantly, the end of Season 2 is when Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) died and showed that TV could break our hearts in ways we didn't yet know were possible. Everything hurt and we were all Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) laying on the floor in our misery, together, knocked out by a sensational and star-making season of television. - Megan Vick]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Justified</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Justified was a competent crime drama in Season 1, but it became one of the best shows of the 2010s after transitioning completely to serialized storytelling, digging deeper into Boyd (Walton Goggins) as a person outside of his complicated relationship with Raylan (Timothy Olyphant), and introducing the memorable weed-dealing Bennett clan, led by Margo Martindale in an Emmy-winning performance, all in Season 2. In a season filled with dynamite performances, Martindale's Mags stood out. Because she gave off the appearance of being a soft and sympathetic woman who had Harlan's best interests at heart, she was frequently underestimated, and it was in these moments that the depth of her ruthlessness and cruelty was revealed. Justified would go on to have several other power-hungry villains throughout its incredible six-season run on FX, but Mags set the bar so high, very few could ever clear it again. - Kaitlin Thomas]]></media:description>

        <media:title>The Leftovers</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Revisiting The Leftovers' first season after seeing the entire series is a very different experience than watching it for the first time. Upon review, the first season deftly, albeit slowly, established the nuances of its post-departure landscape while building to and dropping clues about what was to come from the two seasons to follow. For first-time viewers, though, it can be something of a slog. The narrative is heavy, few of the characters are easy to like, and the narrow focus on a single family can be tedious. Thanks to the meticulous groundwork establishment of the inaugural season, though, the series was finally free to fly in Season 2 and had so much more fun within its mysteriously existential framework. From its tense cavewoman opening sequence to the all-time great episode "International Assassin," the second season introduced exciting new mystical realms for the show to journey through and cemented its legacy as a TV miracle. Believe the Leftovers stans when they yell at you to muscle through Season 1 with the promise that Season 2 will make it all worthwhile; that is absolutely the truth. - Amanda Bell]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Orange Is the New Black</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[In Season 2,Orange Is the New Black realized its greatest strength was in its supporting cast, taking the spotlight off Piper (Taylor Schilling) and shifting it to fan favorite characters like Poussey (Samira Wiley) and Taystee (Danielle Brooks). It introduced Red's (Kate Mulgrew) rival, the unforgettably cold and calculating Vee (Lorraine Toussaint). More than that, it went deeper into showing the realities of being an incarcerated woman and forced the audience to think about the kinds of everyday injustices that don't make headlines. The stakes were high, the comedy and drama equally balanced, and it upped the game in an exciting, nuanced way. - Allison Picurro]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Parks and Recreation</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[After a short, middling first season, Parks and Recreation returned harder, better, faster, and stronger for Season 2. The comedy proved it wasn't afraid to lean in to political satire, presenting takes on marijuana legalization and public sex scandals, and re-established Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) as hard-working and passionate rather than bumbling. It also introduced one of the show's most important characters: Pawnee, Indiana, injecting the town with its own personality. But maybe the best part of the season is how Parks and Recreation realized its strongest element was the chemistry of its ensemble, putting out some of the best group episodes in the show's history, like "Hunting Trip" and "Telethon." Also, come on, Season 2 gave us the first Galentine's Day! It doesn't get much better than that. - Allison Picurro]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Schitt's Creek</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[You have to wait for Schitt's Creek's second season for the show's GIFable "fold the cheese"-style funnies to truly shine through -- it's only after the Roses decide to actually appreciate their quirky new homestead that the show's comedy really starts to flourish. While the show begins as a simple fish-out-of-water story about a family of spoiled and disconnected weirdos, the second season also starts them on the path to making the best of their second chance, and the charm factor is exponentially increased as a result. From there, the characters' hearts, and those of the watching world as well, were on full display, and the series fully reached feel-good favorite status. - Amanda Bell]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Succession</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[HBO's cutthroat family drama Succession is another series which really hit its stride in Season 2. To be fair, it was the last few minutes of the first season's finale that really elevated the power of the story. However, the show found a real rhythm for its characters as everyone in the Roy family circle showed their teeth -- particularly when it came to Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and all of his boar-on-the-floor humiliation tactics -- in their individual pursuits of the same power. Like others on this list, if you made it through the first season, the second season was a major reward, especially when it came to the surprises certain characters had in store for us. From the "L to the OG" to "You can't make a Tomlette without breaking a few Gregs," to that unbelievable finale, Season 2 is the good stuff. - Amanda Bell]]></media:description>

        <media:title>The Vampire Diaries</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The Vampire Diaries took us by storm with a tasty first season, which is why we were all so thunderstruck when it blew the roof off its second. Rather than experiencing a sophomore slump like many breakout hits, it's like someone gave The Vampire Diaries' writers a cheat sheet of all the things that worked well in Season 1, and they flawlessly doubled down on those elements in Season 2. The series most fascinating characters got even more compelling, the world-building became a thing of art, and stakes got higher than ever. If you ever want an example of exactly how you should do a Season 2, look no further than this show. - Lindsay MacDonald]]></media:description>

        <media:title>The 50 Best CW Ships</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[We all know The CW is the prime destination for vampires, superheroes, space travel, but one thing all the networks shows have in common are their epic romances. We love love here at TV Guide, so obviously we jumped at the chance to rank all our favorite ships.Whether you love The Flash, Supergirl, or Arrow, we can all agree that the Arrowverse has ships that are absolutely to die for like Olicity, Westallen, or Sanvers. If you think the heroes are going to run away with this list though, you might be surprised to find out how high some of The Vampire Diaries, The Originals, and Legacies ships rank. Franchises aren't the only ones with sexy romances though! Riverdale and Reign both have multiple ships on this list, and dramas like All American and Dynasty also got some love.Check out our official ranking of the best 50 ships of all time on The CW! As a reminder, this is a ranking of canon ships, so some our faves like SuperCorp and Bellarke did not qualify since they haven't happened on-screen -- yet! ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes a show pairs two unlikely characters together and you're like, "What in the fresh hel– oh no, now I'm in love." That was pretty much the case with Bash and Kenna. Their marriage certainly didn't start out as a loving relationship, but the romance between them grew into something so real that it plucked Bash right out of the love triangle he'd been in with Mary and Francis. Things may not have ended well between them, but we still ship the hell out of this pairing. ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Does it get more epic than Lois Lane and Clark Kent? This iconic couple was first introduced into the Arroverse late in the love story when they'd already gotten together and cleared most of the romantic hurdles we're used to seeing in a superhero romance. We're not mad at it though, since now we get to see them as supportive partners who love and respect one another through anything. And even better, we now get to explore them as parents on their own spin-off, Superman and Lois. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>48. Cat and Vincent, Beauty and the Beast</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Who doesn't love a tale as old as time? Granted, this version happens to have genetic experimentation, shady government organizations, and a lot of death... but at its core it's still a love story! One of the best things about Cat and Vincent is that no matter what went wrong or who screwed up, you were still inevitably left rooting for this couple, which is more than some of the others on this list can say. There's definitely something to be said for keeping the fans happy and invested, and Beauty and the Beast did that at every turn.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>47. Brainy and Nia, Supergirl</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Not only is Brainy and Nia The CW's first ship involving a transgender character, but they're also one of the cutest damn romances the network has ever created. Nia and Brainy's respective awkward tendencies somehow synced up perfectly with one another, and they've both learned so much from each other -- both good and bad -- over the course of their relationship. Supergirl doesn't often spend enough time exploring this relationship, which is the only reason it's not ranked higher. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>46. Macy and Harry, Charmed</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[This ship kind of came out of left field, but the best ones always do! Sure, Harry and Macy have had more ups and downs than most ships could manage in just two seasons, but that hasn't stopped us from falling head over heels in love with their love. And yes, we've watched the scene of them dancing more times than is probably but healthy, but honestly – totally worth it. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>45. Blaine and Peyton, iZombie</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Blaine and Peyton walk the line between sexy and scary extremely well, and while we're all aboard this ship, it's also kind of nice that iZombie hasn't attempted to water Blaine down to make his romance with Peyton more palatable. That being said, the mutual feelings between these two allowed us to see a wilder side of Peyton, and a more subdued, domestic side of Blaine, which was a nice change-up for both of them. Great characters are all about seeing the dimensions, and though they're not together anymore, we wouldn't rule out a rekindling... eventually.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[LaVon and Lemon started off as star-crossed lovers, and even though their affair ended up hurting George, there was no denying the couple was meant to be together. They were Blue Bell town royalty and had the kind of can't-eat-can't-sleep kind of love that dreams are made of. Plus, Lemon is the only one who could keep LaVon in line and he's the only one that could find her demanding nature endearing. No one else made as much sense as these two.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Mikita is one of those completely and totally underrated ships that we just had to put on this list. While the relationship admittedly got a little stale towards the end of the series, Season 1 has some of the greatest shipper scenes of all time. Starting them off on opposite sides of the Division takedown juxtaposed with their past mentor/mentee relationship was the perfect formula to make us fall in love with this romance.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[It may have taken them FOREVER to get together, but Luke and Lorelai are pretty much the perfect example of a friends-to-lovers romance that feels organic and earned. Luke never pressured her to be more, though it was clear he always held a candle for her, and once Lorelai realized her own feelings, she was all in on their relationship. It's rare to find a ship that's just as amazing in the series finale as they were when they were introduced in the pilot, but Luke and Lorelai managed to pull it off.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Who would have thought Sam Winchester would actually find a stable and solid relationship 15 years into the series? Definitely not us! Women seem to come and go in Sam's life (typically tragically) and for a while it seemed like Eileen would be more of the same. When it comes down to it though, Sam and Elieen have something mature, real, and not destined for heartbreak, and this point, they both deserve exactly that! ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Walt and Bennet's relationship might not have received as much screen time as it deserved on the '80s-set The Carrie Diaries, but it was remarkable in that it also propelled Walt's thoughtful coming out story. It took a little while for the two of them to get on the same page because of their differences, but they made it there eventually, and it was one of the things we loved most (and still miss!) about this canceled-too-soon coming-of-age story.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Let's pour one out for this epic ship we loved and lost. Zari and Nate stole our hearts (and created one hell of ship name with SteelHacker) before timeline shenanigans got in the way and gave us a whole new Zari. And now she's hooking up with Constantine, and our feelings are very confused. Is it weird that we kind of just want the three of them to be a thruple so we can ship ALL the things? ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>38. Spencer and Layla, All American</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[We all love a good teen romance, but it's pretty rare to find a relationship that's as nuanced as Spencer and Layla's considering they're technically still just kids. Even though Spencer's had so many ups and downs in his life, he's still been endlessly supportive of Layla and he's tried to stand by her, even when she didn't want him to. That's pretty selfless for a 16-year-old kid. As for Layla, well, she doesn't trust many people enough to let them in, but Spencer seems to be the exception to that rule, which is just beautiful. ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[We'll be the first to admit, when Katy Keene first premiered, we weren't too hot on the romance between Katy and KO. The couple that's already together in the pilot never lasts long, right? Boy do we feel silly now. Katy and KO may have had to navigate rocky waters, but through it all they've remained deeply in love with each other. So in love, in fact, that they're both willing to sacrifice being together so that they each can chase the opportunities they need to pursue their dreams. Talk about sacrifice!]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[When Julian was first introduced as a love interest for Brooke, we were more than a little worried she was about to be drawn into another love triangle with Peyton. Luckily, these ladies didn't have to fight it out over a boy again, and Brooke ended up finding her soulmate in the one guy who understood her better than anyone else. ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Let's be real, Anissa is a thunderstorm of a woman, and there aren't many people that could handle a relationship with someone as headstrong and passionate as her. Grace absolutely can though, and over the course of the series, we've seen both girls be so caring and vulnerable with one another that it's hard to imagine either of them fitting so perfectly with anyone else. When you're in a bad mood, just go watch all their scenes on repeat -- it's sure to turn your day around!]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, we put Clark Kent and Lois Lane on this list twice. What of it? While Lana dominated the first few seasons of the series as Clark's love interest, Lois definitely took over (with much more success) when she arrived on the scene in Season 4. Despite a totally longer than necessary arc where Lois didn't realize Clark was also the Blur, this relationship shone through as the best ship on the show and one of the top to ever grace The CW network.]]></media:description>

Despite prejudice, other partners, and even the law getting in the way of their love, Kate and Sophie's undeniable chemistry just kept drawing them together again and again. It's not every day you get an LGBTQ ship in the superhero genre, much less one that's got a powerhouse duo like this in it!]]></media:description>

Though he was originally hired by Fallon's father to be her husband (and thus prevent her from marrying someone else), Liam wormed his way into her heart, and now their relationship is one of the best the show has ever created. When a girl like Fallon tells you she'd choose you, you know you've got a real romance on your hands.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>30. Annie and Liam, 90210</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Look, let's not mince words. Annie and Liam had their problems, that's for sure. On a show like 90210, where kidnappings, pill switches, and teenage prostitution are common occurrences, there's virtually no way to have a normal relationship, but Annie and Liam came as close as they could. Watching their romance grow out of a genuine friendship was a nice change-up for this series, and all the drama that came after was worth it when we saw Liam go down on one knee in the finale. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>29. George and Nick, Nancy Drew</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Nancy Drew decided to say "screw the best friend and the ex-boyfriend" rules by putting Nick and George together, and honestly, we're so glad it did. George and Nick complement each other so well! George is grumpy on the outside and soft and gooey inside, and Nick is the exact opposite, but somehow they just work. And for the most part, the series has avoided pitting Nancy and George against each other for the sake of pointless drama, which only made us love the show more!]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[When the reboot first debuted, we were kind of worried that the new Liz and Max wouldn't live up to the epic romance of the original Roswell. How foolish we feel now! The chemistry between these two has been off the charts since the pilot episode, and they're the kind relationship that you just know is endgame no matter what. They've had their fair share of problems -- secrets, dead sisters, secrets about dead sisters -- but when push comes to shove, nothing can truly keep Max and Liz apart. ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[It's not often The CW makes us ship "the parents," but Joe and Cecile are absolutely the exception to that rule. Their relationship has arguably been the most supportive and loving marriage we've ever seen on network TV, even though both of these characters are still learning and growing amidst all the chaos happening every week in Central City. This ship is also a great example of how wonderful it can be to discover your soulmate later in life when you're finally ready to meet the one. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>26. Veronica and Archie, Riverdale</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[This one might seem a little predictable, but we're suckers for canon-compliant romances. Archie and Veronica were an iconic ship from the Archie comics, so naturally watching them get together on Riverdale was pretty awesome. Not to mention, these two have had some of the steamiest love scenes we've ever seen -- is The CW even allowed to pair two people this beautiful together? ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[They were on and then off and then on again and then… OK, so we lost track of how many times Thea and Roy broke up and got back together again, but when you've got chemistry like theirs, it doesn't really matter. In the end, we were thrilled to see them get engaged, and we firmly believe they're living a heroic happily ever after out there somewhere. ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[When we first met Asher, we were ready to hate the obligatory ignorant bully stewing in his own white privilege, but then something totally nuts happened. He turned out to be a kind of OK person? Made more and more OK every time he interacted with Olivia to the point where we actually like this kid now! That's just the effect someone as beautiful and resilient as Olivia has on people, we guess. Never underestimate the power of a guy who brings you ice cream and then asks for your consent before kissing you! ]]></media:description>

Frary didn't just have to tackle the typical obstacles of young love during their time together, they had to deal with assassination plots, warring countries, and shaky alliances on top of it all. Despite all the pain and suffering they experienced in their lives, they finally got to reunite in the afterlife when Reign came to a close in a montage that -- admit it -- absolutely made you cry.]]></media:description>

They had chemistry off the charts, some serious shared trauma about losing their dads to hunting, and very similar personalities – maybe that's why they were always bumping heads? For whatever reason, the show decided not to pursue this relationship even though it had laid all the perfect groundwork, and then Jo died and that was that. Are we still bitter? You bet your ass. ]]></media:description>

Sara's a resurrected assassin who isn't one for settling down and Ava is a clone of, well, many, which should have made their relationship a total non-starter. However, their sizzling chemistry and heartfelt conversations made them a definite favorite, and we're confident that this ship is endgame, no matter where the Waverider takes them.]]></media:description>

She found an epic love in her teenage sweetheart, Landon, who helped her learn to open her heart again and let people in.

Penelope may have looked like a an evil ex at first glance, but it quickly became apparent that she was using her mean girl tactics on people who didn't treat Josie the way she deserved. We shouldn't find that attractive, but we totally do. If they'd been given more time together, we have faith that Josie would have tempered Penelope's harsher tendencies and Penelope would have pushed Josie to be more outgoing and independent.  ]]></media:description>

Ultimately, their difference of opinion on having kids drove these two apart, but we're holding out one last kernel of hope that they'll find their way back to each other one day.

        <media:title>12. Logan and Veronica, Veronica Mars</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[When your ship name is LoVe, is there any doubt that it's meant to be? To be honest, if someone told us that Logan and Veronica would be endgame after watching the first few episodes of Veronica Mars Season 1, we would have thrown serious shade since he totally lived up to his reputation as Neptune High's "obligatory psychotic jackass." Despite all odds though, these two just seemed to fit together though, and Logan was always the only one that could really keep up with Veronica's quick wit. We almost loved watching them banter as much as watching them make out in the girls' bathroom. And yeah, we're all going to just ignore what happened to this couple in the revival.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>11. Murphy and Emori, The 100</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone totally had Murphy pegged as a loner (and kind of an ass) until Emori showed up and changed everything. For the most part, there's very little Murphy won't do, or anyone he won't sacrifice, to stay alive, but the line gets drawn firmly at Emori. He'd probably sacrifice his own life for her at this point, and considering his reputation as the cockroach of the group, honestly, that's just beautiful. And yeah, he'd probably burn the world down if anything happened to her, but like... same. Protect Emori at all costs. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>10. Freya and Keelin, The Originals</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Their relationship may have gotten off to a rocky start (kidnapping does that to a couple sometimes), but Freya and Keelin managed to develop a rock-solid relationship built on trust, love, and respect in a city where that's hard to find among family, let alone strangers. These lovely ladies walked down the aisle before The Originals ended, and there's seriously no one who deserves a happily ever after more!]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[How do we put this? Darryl and White Josh give us life. It was refreshing to see Darryl come out as a bisexual man and subsequently embark on a loving relationship with White Josh, who might have been the only truly well-adjusted person on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. And although they broke up because Darryl wanted a child and White Josh did not, their breakup actually allowed the show to tell a number of interesting stories. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>8. Zoe and Wade, Hart of Dixie</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Zoe and Wade were a classic "opposites attract" story: she was a self-centered doctor from New York who tried to bring formal shorts to The CW before Petra on Jane the Virgin actually made them work, and he was a sexy, small town bartender from Alabama who appeared to be every bit the stereotypical ladies' man. However, over time Zoe and Wade's love story became the foundation of Hart of Dixie, and as the two learned not only to grow as people but to grow together as well, it only made the show -- and their characters -- stronger.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>7. Jefferson and Lynn, Black Lightning</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Black Lightning took a more mature approach to the superhero genre with its middle-aged vigilante Jefferson Pierce, so naturally the series did the same with its main romantic subplot. Jefferson and Lynn's story started at the rekindling of their romance after a long marriage and semi-messy divorce, which made the ship exciting for two reasons. One, there's two decades of history between them for fans to speculate and gush over, making their flashback possibilities endless. Two, Jefferson and Lynn showed us what a mature relationship built on trust and teamwork -- despite its many flaws and uncertainties -- can look like. And holy crap, we LOVE it.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>6. Jess and Rory, Gilmore Girls</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Rory Gilmore has had a few great loves in her life, but none of them ever fit her quite as well as Stars Hollow's own bad boy with a heart of gold, Jess Mariano. Sure, Jess made some serious mistakes in their relationship (bailing on Rory and taking off for California for starters), but he did truly love Rory and complemented the bookworm-ish intellectual side of her. And let's not forget, Rory was the one who actually inspired Jess to get his life in order when all was said and done. If we ever get another Gilmore Girls revival, these two better end up together or TVs will be thrown out of windows.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>5. Klaus and Caroline, The Vampire Diaries/The Originals</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Klaus and Caroline's love story has been unconventional to say the least, spanning thousands of miles, nearly 20 years, and two different TV shows! No matter what path they take though, it always seems to lead back to each other, which is probably why Legacies even drops the occasional Klaroline Easter eggs here and there. Though they didn't end up together when all was said and done, we'll always remember that he pledged to be her last love, however long it takes.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>4. Clarke and Lexa, The 100</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Clexa was a groundbreaking romance in a lot of ways, but mainly because it finally ushered a bisexual lead into the ranks of CW main characters, and not a minute too soon. The 100 didn't play up or play down the implications of Clarke or Lexa's sexuality -- ain't nobody got time for that in an apocalypse -- choosing to focus instead on the strength of their connection and the beauty of their love story. No matter how you feel about the tragic end that befell this ship, it's hard to deny that the romance between these two women was one of the best things The 100 ever did.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>3. Betty and Jughead, Riverdale</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[We all thought we knew what shipping was, but then Bughead came along and threw us for a total loop. Maybe it's the way they constantly look at each other with heart eyes, or how they make the perfect investigative duo with tons of sexy vibes, but Bughead somehow turns every moment into a shipping moment. They also happen to be the only ones who could ever understand each other's nutty family drama which is seriously saying something on Riverdale.]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes the guy you love is a sarcastic, blood-hungry murderer who happens to be the brother of the other guy you love, but that's just life in Mystic Falls, right? Damon may have started off as the baddest of the bad, but ultimately his love for Elena -- and her love and faith in Damon -- redeemed him, turning him into a loyal friend, a loving brother and a guy worthy of living happily ever after with the woman he loves. Plus, we occasionally got hotter-than-hot sex scenes on whichever surface happened to be available and a #DelenaRainKiss. This is the ship of dreams, people.]]></media:description>

        <media:title>1. Oliver and Felicity, Arrow</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Olicity is one of those weird ships that was probably never in the original plans for the show but somehow became a cornerstone of it. Oliver and Felicity's chemistry was palpable from the get-go, and they've traveled from strangers to friends to husband and wife, despite the seriously rocky road they had to take to get there. They're also one of the rare couples that provide fans with just as much entertainment during their domestic happiness as their angsty breakups, which is not easy. It all worked out in the end though, and thank goodness we got to see their happy ending in the afterlife in the Arrow series finale!]]></media:description>

        <media:title>Yes, that is Rod Serling that you hear</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[While Season 2 does not offer a full-on meta "Blurryman" reveal sequence like we saw in Season 1's finale, one wink to him comes along in "8," as the scientists at the remote research station play a documentary about sea-diving. The narrator is none other than Serling himself, and it appears to be a clip from The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau, which just so happens to feature an octopus that greatly resembles the monster of the day in this new episode. ]]></media:description>

        <media:title>The Kanamits return</media:title>
        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The biggest tie-in to the classic series arrives in Season 2's finale, "You Also Might Like," when the Kanamits return to Earth. You might recognize these big headed extraterrestrials from the classic 1962 The Twilight Zone episode "To Serve Man." And in their newest outing, they are once again fooling mankind into thinking they are benevolent. Only, instead of delivering a coded cookbook to Earthlings, the Kanamits have secretly studied human commercials for tips on how to best market their Egg, a product which promised to make everything better forever, but which decidedly will not. ]]></media:description>

        <media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The Kanamits also briefly appear -- in animated form, at least -- in the premiere episode, "Meet in the Middle," as well. Those silvery space aliens can be seen in this quick glimpse at a cereal box in the store where the lead character Phil (Jimmi Simpson) works. The twist is that, unlike what happened in "To Serve Man," this time, it's Kanamunch on the menu! ]]></media:description>

      <link>https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-secretary-devos-virtual-2020-federal-student-aid-training-conference</link>
      <description>Thank you, Mark, for that kind introduction and for your  reliable leadership at FSA.
Thanks, as well, to all of you—thousands of you—who join  us for this year’s conference. It’s exciting to have a record-breaking turnout,  though of course I’d much rather we all be together in person.
The FSA conference this year is like none other.  Navigating the COVID crisis has been challenging—on many fronts. And I’m  inspired by how each of you has risen to the occasion in different ways and how  you continue to put students first.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I received a package from my sister in law, Marsha, with a beautiful homemade face mask. Gratitude washed over me. Her generosity released a cascade of feelings that researchers acknowledge lead to happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these unprecedented times, it is easy to lose sight of happiness and self-care. The following 6 learnable skills are proven to increase health and wellbeing and reduce stress and anxiety. Now is an ideal time to get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gratitude&lt;/strong&gt;.  In spite of challenges, it’s uplifting to recognize the efforts many people make every day; the healthcare worker tending to the sick, the store employee stocking shelves with food, the teachers bringing the classroom and learning into the home.  Writing in a journal or listening to a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRBwUqsSEsQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gratitude practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can help re-enforce the gratitude you feel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generosity&lt;/strong&gt;. Sharing a kind word, a simple note of thanks, or lending a hand to someone else can lift your mood and theirs. Doing just one generous act each day begins a cycle that can inspire others to pay it forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;. Inspiration can come from anywhere. My mother was inspired by Marsha, and began making masks this week for the folks in her retirement community. She’s in her 80’s with poor vision, yet she’s engaging in this new sense of purpose.  As Thoreau said &lt;em&gt;“One is not born into the world to do everything, but to do something”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;What is your ‘something’?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;. This may feel impossible during a pandemic, yet research shows focusing on the good helps you feel better, sleep better and be healthier. Balance pandemic news by tuning into the &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good News Network (GNN)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and explore all the good things happening. It may even spark a few new ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Connection&lt;/strong&gt;. There are many online and mobile resources like Zoom and Facetime to creatively connect people who are sequestered in their homes. A few ‘face-to-face” minutes can boost your focus and your productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness&lt;/strong&gt;.  Practicing mindfulness is the glue that ties these skills together. When your body and mind are settled, creativity and compassion begin to flow naturally. Inner Explorer’s free mindfulness app &lt;a href="https://innerexplorer.org/compass/family_onboarding" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I AM PRESENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, offers families brief daily practices that reduce stress, increase learning readiness and bolster resiliency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inner Explorer, in collaboration with LG Electronics, Discovery Education and others, has brought the &lt;a href="https://lgexperiencehappiness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience Happiness Initiative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to over 3 million children and teens.  This crisis is providing a beautiful opportunity to practice being mindful, grateful, generous, positive, purposeful and connected. Please join our growing community and Discover Your Happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos highlighting each of these learnable skills, as well as family activities and classroom content from the Experience Happiness Initiative and the &lt;a href="https://www.learnexperiencehappiness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Discover Your Happy&lt;/a&gt;, a program created in partnership with LG and Discovery Education, are available at no-cost to families and can also be found on the &lt;a href="https://app.discoveryeducation.com/learn/channels/channel/effd9c43-17c2-45e9-a3a1-766ff0eeca2d"&gt;Discover Your Happy channel&lt;/a&gt; in Discovery Education &lt;em&gt;Experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As kids continue to navigate the new school year, whether in-person or virtually, being aware of overlapping diseases and social realities has become more important than ever. Beyond the ever-present threats posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, there are &lt;a href="https://www.aafa.org/asthma-facts/#:~:text=Asthma%20is%20more%20common%20in%20children%20than%20adults.&amp;#38;text=Asthma%20is%20more%20common%20in%20boys%20than%20girls.&amp;#38;text=Currently%2C%20there%20are%20about%206.2,age%20of%2018%20with%20asthma.&amp;#38;text=In%202017%2C%201%20in%2012%20children%20had%20asthma." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;6.2 million children&lt;/a&gt; living with asthma in the United States alone. For these children, respiratory diseases like COVID-19 pose additional threats to a healthy life, and complications are everywhere – even from cleaning products, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30353-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; finds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Added to the mix are racial disparities related to respiratory illness. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; shows cases are up to 2.8x higher among people of color and that Black people, specifically, are &lt;a href="https://www.aafa.org/asthma-facts/#:~:text=Asthma%20is%20more%20common%20in%20children%20than%20adults.&amp;#38;text=Asthma%20is%20more%20common%20in%20boys%20than%20girls.&amp;#38;text=Currently%2C%20there%20are%20about%206.2,age%20of%2018%20with%20asthma.&amp;#38;text=In%202017%2C%201%20in%2012%20children%20had%20asthma." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;3x more likely&lt;/a&gt; to die of an asthma attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Opportunities exist to empower students to make health and science personal by connecting to these realities in the classroom.  Real-world, no-cost resources include those from Generation Health – a program from AstraZeneca, Learning Undefeated, and Discovery Education. This platform makes the connection between students’ health and the science behind the prevention and treatment of disease with standards-aligned experiential learning resources for students in grades 6-8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Students and educators can kick off the conversation about preventative measures and innovative solutions to complicated topics, like asthma and COVID-19, with key resources such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.howsciencepowersus.com/education-resources/educator-resources-respiratory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ALL NEW “Air Quality and You” Digital Lesson Bundle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Learn how air quality and noncommunicable diseases, such as asthma, can affect you and the people around us in three 45-minute sessions. Through this digital lesson, students will gain an understanding about how asthma causes symptoms that make breathing more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Students will also explore how substances in the environment can enter the body and how pollutants can trigger or exacerbate respiratory symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.howsciencepowersus.com/education-resources/educator-resources-respiratory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Escape the Pandemic Activity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;In less than an hour, guide students (or have them direct their own learning!) to discover how scientists race around the clock to find a cure for a flu pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Through this real-world scenario, students will see how a virus spreads from person-to-person around the world and has the power to affect a very large number of people. By the end, students discover the health risks of influenzas and various ways to stop the spread of disease just in time for the start of flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These digital lesson bundles are full of research-based resources and content designed to make anywhere learning fun and easy for the teacher and students. With Generation Health content in hand, educators can inspire students to consider STEM careers while learning together about critical healthcare topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="fmr-associated-content-region"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We know kids don’t live in a vacuum and are faced with important decisions each day. That’s why Responsibility.org’s &lt;em&gt;Ask, Listen, Learn: Kids and Alcohol Don’t Mix &lt;/em&gt;underage drinking prevention program and Discovery Education teamed up in 2018 to deliver award-winning prevention resources designed to spark conversations about alcohol, both in schools and at home, to prevent underage drinking. Now, we’re proud to release brand-new content that supports teachers, parents, and students in engaging in even more conversations to keep kids substance-free by addressing how underage cannabis use affects the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Cannabis legalization is on the rise in many states: only in eight states and federally is the substance still fully illegal. Yet, as marijuana legislation becomes more common, any form of legalization is only for adults 21+. According to recent &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/marijuana" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 1-in-6 people who start using the substance before the age of 18 can become addicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To help address this issue,&lt;em&gt; Ask, Listen, Learn &lt;/em&gt;in partnership with Discovery Education offers a new suite of science-based, no-cost resources focused on how cannabis affects the developing brain. Designed with the whole child in mind, these new resources focus on how kids interact with society and how society influences their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bring this topic into the classroom with these three activities (appropriate for both asynchronous and synchronous learning):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marijuana and Adolescent Health&lt;/em&gt; – Delve into the recommendations and reasoning behind minimum age requirements and the role of legalization by having students role-play as elected officials in a debate focused on the importance of health education in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marijuana and Your Brain&lt;/em&gt; – Separate cannabis facts from fiction by exploring the role of the developing brain’s endocannabinoid system and how its neurotransmitters are affected through creative writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How and Why to Say “NO”&lt;/em&gt; – Foster student collaboration around the short-term and long-term effects of cannabis on the developing brain with refusal and exit-strategy practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Educators can help students continue these conversations at home with resources designed specifically for families. As we know, parents are the #1 influence on a kid’s decision to drink – or not to drink – alcohol, so we developed resources to support parents and guardians when having conversations with kids about many risky behaviors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;When it Comes to Teens&lt;/em&gt;: What You Need to Know about Cannabis – Help families engage in meaningful discussions with kids to keep them substance-free and offer strategies to keep the lines of communication open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Together, let’s equip students in grades 5-7 with the tools to say “YES” to a healthy lifestyle and “NO” to all risky behaviors.  Informed students make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Access program resources at &lt;a href="https://www.discoverbrainbodybehavior.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;DiscoverBrainBodyBehavior.com&lt;/a&gt; or through &lt;a href="https://www.discoveryeducation.com/solutions/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Discovery Education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.discoveryeducation.com/solutions/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://app.discoveryeducation.com/learn/channels/channel/5599ab6d-5216-41c4-bc3f-ff5da0490e4c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask, Listen, Learn&lt;/em&gt; channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Explore even more content from Responsibility.org’s &lt;a href="https://asklistenlearn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask, Listen, Learn: Kids and Alcohol Don’t Mix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whose mission is to eliminate underage drinking and keep kids alcohol- and cannabis-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Connecting students to financial know-how, including information about financial institutions, provides a means for young people to achieve their dreams. With no cost resources from&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pathwayinschools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pathway to Financial Success in School&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;– a program from Discover Financial Services and Discovery Education – educators now have a way to give students the tools they need to succeed financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Designed for wherever learning takes place, the all-new self-paced modules for high school students connect the classroom to the real-world in meaningful and accessible ways.  Whether planning for college or other major life decisions, these modules help students construct healthy money habits that last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Understanding Financial Institutions&lt;/strong&gt; module, high schoolers practice the critical thinking skills needed to decide which bank or credit union is right for them. This module also helps students explore the world of financial institutions to discover how they work and how the online-only environment transforms money management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Students can then go even deeper in the &lt;strong&gt;Opening New Accounts&lt;/strong&gt; module. In this module students learn the answers to questions such like: What do you need to do before opening a bank account? Which institution meets your needs? How does age impact accounts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pathwayinschools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pathway to Financial Success in School&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;resources can be integrated into instruction in a variety of ways. No matter how they are used, they will help all students take control of their financial future.

      <title>Comb of a lifetime: a new method for fluorescence microscopy</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/01/210101141902.htm</link>
      <description>Conventional fluorescence microscopy provides poor quantitative information of the sample because it only captures fluorescence intensity, which changes frequently and depends on external factors. Now, scientists have developed a new fluorescence microscopy technique to measure both fluorescence intensity and lifetime. Their method does not require mechanical scanning of a focal point; instead, it produces images from all points in the sample simultaneously, enabling a more quantitative study of dynamic biological and chemical processes.</description>

      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201231091048.htm</link>
      <description>When fat cells in the body are stuffed with excess fat, the surrounding tissue becomes inflamed. That chronic, low-level inflammation is one of the driving factors behind many of the diseases associated with obesity. Now, scientists have discovered a type of cell responsible, at least in mice, for triggering this inflammation in fat tissue. Their findings could eventually lead to new ways to treat obesity.</description>

      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201229104525.htm</link>
      <description>What happens in the brain when our conscious awareness fades during general anesthesia and normal sleep? Scientists studied this question with novel experimental designs and functional brain imaging. They succeeded in separating the specific changes related to consciousness from the more widespread overall effects, and discovered that the effects of anesthesia and sleep on brain activity were surprisingly similar. These novel findings point to a common central core brain network fundamental for human consciousness.</description>

      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201229104523.htm</link>
      <description>Small studies have suggested that a group of medications called RAS inhibitors may be harmful in persons with advanced chronic kidney disease, and physicians therefore often stop the treatment in such patients. Researchers now show that although stopping the treatment is linked to a lower risk of requiring dialysis, it is also linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular events and death.</description>

      <description>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex psychiatric disorder brought on by physical and/or psychological trauma. How its symptoms, including anxiety, depression and cognitive disturbances arise remains incompletely understood and unpredictable. Treatments and outcomes could potentially be improved if doctors could better predict who would develop PTSD. Now, researchers using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have found potential brain biomarkers of PTSD in people with traumatic brain injury (TBI).</description>

      <description>Imaging techniques enable a detailed look inside an organism. But interpreting the data is time-consuming and requires a great deal of experience. Artificial neural networks open up new possibilities: They require just seconds to interpret whole-body scans of mice and to segment and depict the organs in colors, instead of in various shades of gray. This facilitates the analysis considerably.</description>

      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201228095432.htm</link>
      <description>Astronomers are studying black holes that could have formed in the early universe, before stars and galaxies were born. Such primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all or part of dark matter, be responsible for some of the observed gravitational waves signals, and seed supermassive black holes found in the center of our Galaxy and other galaxies.</description>

      <title>Discovery boosts theory that life on Earth arose from RNA-DNA mix</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201228095428.htm</link>
      <description>Chemists have made a discovery that supports a surprising new view of how life originated on our planet. They demonstrated that a simple compound called diamidophosphate (DAP), which was plausibly present on Earth before life arose, could have chemically knitted together tiny DNA building blocks called deoxynucleosides into strands of primordial DNA.</description>

      <title>Astrocytes eat connections to maintain plasticity in adult brains</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201224090406.htm</link>
      <description>Developing brains constantly sprout new neuronal connections called synapses as they learn and remember. Important connections -- the ones that are repeatedly introduced, such as how to avoid danger -- are nurtured and reinforced, while connections deemed unnecessary are pruned away. Adult brains undergo similar pruning, but it was unclear how or why synapses in the adult brain get eliminated. Now, a team of researchers has found the mechanism underlying plasticity and, potentially, neurological disorders in adult brains.</description>
