      <description>The United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey and the United States Coast Guard Sectors New York and Delaware Bay announced on May 10th 19 new grants to promote the health and living resources of the coast and oceans of New Jersey. Gateway National Recreation Area received one of the environmental and conservation grants for $46,000 to remove marine debris along a 1.5 mile stretch of intertidal and foredune habitat at the North Beach of Sandy Hook. The grant was funded by community service payments made by Holy House Shipping AB, a Swedish shipping company that pled guilty to dumping oil-contaminated waste into the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/grant-for-marine-removal-at-north-beach-sandy-hook.htm</description>

      <title>Grant Received for Removal of Marine Debris from North Beach at Sandy Hook</title>
      <link>https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/grant-received-for-removal-of-marine-debris-from-north-beach-at-sandy-hook.htm</link>
      <description>Gateway National Recreation Area received a grant for removal of marine debris from North Beach at Sandy Hook, New Jersey. This was one of 19 grants announced today by the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey and the U.S. Coast Guard Sectors New York and Delaware Bay. The 19 new grants totaled $1,531,391 and are to promote the health and living resources of the coast and oceans of New Jersey. The grants were funded by community service payments made by three shipping companies as part of their criminal sentences for violating federal laws aimed at eliminating vessel pollution.  The three criminal cases were U.S. v. Clipper Wonsild Tankers Holding A/S et. al., U.S. v. Dalnave Navigation Inc., and U.S. v. Holy House Shipping AB.  The prosecution of the cases by the U.S. Attorney’s Office was made possible through the combined efforts of the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division. https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/grant-received-for-removal-of-marine-debris-from-north-beach-at-sandy-hook.htm</description>

      <title>Rude Awakenings Program Delivers Lifesaving Messages to Teens</title>
      <link>https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/rude-awakenings-april-2010.htm</link>
      <description>“Wham!” was the sound of an airbag as it hit the unbuckled driver with enough force to blow the ‘test dummy’s” head twenty feet in the air.  “Crunch!” was the sound of a vehicle as its solid metal body smashed into pieces on the hard asphalt at over 60 miles per hour. But, absolutely not a single sound was heard when Allison Wheeler recalled the events leading up to her younger brother’s death in a drunk driving incident. “Oh my God,” were the words heard over and over again from teens attending the Rude Awakenings presentations and demonstrations at Gateway National Recreation Area’s Sandy Hook Unit on April 22. https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/rude-awakenings-april-2010.htm</description>

      <description>Macy’s motto, “Volunteering is Always in Fashion,” fits their commitment to volunteerism to a “t”. In fact that motto was sported on the t-shirts worn by their volunteers at the Frank Charles Park Clean-up on April 19.  The volunteers looked their best and helped the park look its best because of their hard work. A group of about 35 volunteers, from Macy’s and Bank of America, in partnership with the National Parks Foundation and the National Park Service, contributed their time and effort to clean up the playgrounds, baseball fields and shoreline of Frank Charles Park. The site is located in the Jamaica Bay Unit of Gateway National Recreation Area. https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/frank-charles-park-clean-up-april-2010.htm</description>

      <description>Hear Every Voice: NYC and the National Park Service can now be seen online at www.thirteen.org. Created by Stephen Ogumah, this video documents a civic engagement project with the residents of Brooklyn and Queens, particularly the Caribbean immigrant communities. It was produced in partnership with Brooklyn College of the City University of New York and Gateway National Recreation Area, a unit of the National Park Service. This project was created to coincide with the airing of the Ken Burns documentary about National Parks, America’s Best Idea, in September 2009. https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/hear-every-voice.htm</description>

      <title>Termination of fort Hancock rehabilitation agreement announced</title>
      <link>https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/termination-of-fort-hancock-rehabilitation-agreement-announced.htm</link>
      <description>National Park Service (NPS) Northeast Regional Director Dennis R. Reidenbach today announced that an independent third party has concluded its final review of the financing commitments submitted by Sandy Hook Partners, LLC (SHP) for the rehabilitation of historic Fort Hancock at Sandy Hook. Based on its review of all the information submitted, the independent third party reviewer, Maurice Robinson and Associates LLC, has determined that the financing commitments made by SHP are insufficient to meet the purposes and requirements of the lease. 	
Based on this determination, the NPS has notified Sandy Hook Partners President James S. Wassel that the lease is null and void. https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/termination-of-fort-hancock-rehabilitation-agreement-announced.htm</description>

      <description>On Tuesday afternoon there was a chlorine leak in the Sandy Hook Sewage Treatment Plant located on the eastern side of the peninsula, near Gunnison Beach. Hazmat teams responded and contained the leak. As a precaution, visitors were escorted off Gunnison Beach due to their proximity to the plant. No employees or visitors were injured. The source of the leak was discovered and repairs were made during the overnight hours. The plant is back in operation today. https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/sandy-hook-beaches-reopen.htm</description>

      <description>Anglers at the Sandy Hook Unit of Gateway National Recreation Area can now do their part for the environment thanks to a grant from the Sandy Hook Foundation that provides bins for recycling discarded fishing line.  Monofilament fishing line, another name for single-strand, high-density, nylon fishing line that is used on fishing reels and in the manufacturing of fishing nets, is responsible for untold damage to endangered marine wildlife such as birds, fish, manatees and sea turtles, and poses a hazard to boaters and swimmers. https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/no-string-attached-sandy-hook-foundation-helps-park-adopt-fishing-line-recycling-program.htm</description>

      <title>Teacher Not Whiling but Working and Blogging Away the Summer</title>
      <link>https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/teacher-not-whiling-but-working-and-blogging-away-the-summer.htm</link>
      <description>For many people, a trip to one of our country’s national parks is the culmination of a life long dream.  “I always wanted to see Yellowstone,” or “When we retire we’re going to see…(fill in the name of your favorite national park),” are just a few of the comments rangers hear from visitors. Indeed, visits to national parks enrich the lives of many in this nation. However, not everyone can take the big “dream vacation”— often due to a variety of social and economic factors.  Also, many people don't realize that there are plenty of national parks, like Gateway National Recreation Area in NY/NJ, right near their own backyards. The National Park Service (NPS) Teacher to Ranger to Teacher (TRT) Program offers a solution for those who may never get to parks out west and beyond. At Gateway National Recreation Area (GATE), Teacher-Ranger Renay Moran-Kurklen is one of those teachers. https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/teacher-not-whiling-but-working-and-blogging-away-the-summer.htm</description>

The Monarch is perhaps the best known of all North American butterflies and two groups have been working together to see that there is a "butterfly break" for the Monarch and all butterflies that come to and through Gateway National Recreation Area's (GATE) Great Kills Park on Staten Island. https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/gateway-gives-butterflies-a-break.htm</description>

      <description>In an effort to better manage the traffic delays leaving Sandy Hook caused by New Jersey’s Highlands Bridge replacement project, today National Park Service officials met with representatives from the New Jersey Department of Transportation (DOT), including the Director of the Division of Traffic Operations and the Director of the Division of Construction Services and Materials. “The meeting was extremely productive,” said Dave Avrin, Superintendent of the Sandy Hook Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area. “The DOT definitely shares our concerns about the impact the bridge construction is having on our visitors. We have worked together to find workable traffic flow solutions for years, and beginning this weekend we will all be implementing some changes that will make a difference to motorists when they exit the park,” Avrin added. https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/changes-will-help-motorists-exit-sandy-hook.htm</description>

      <title>Long-term Resource Management Under a Changing Climate</title>
      <link>https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/long-term-resource-management-under-a-changing-climate.htm</link>
      <description>Over the next century, climate change will significantly affect human and ecological systems. In the past few decades, climate change science has grown in certainty. While attention has historically focused on mitigation efforts, adaptation is beginning to emerge as an important area. Climate adaptation is critical, since current GHG concentrations will already cause climate change impacts in the next few decades. As a result, society must
begin to take steps to prepare for and buffer against climate change impacts. At Gateway National Recreation Area, climate change adaptation means increasing ecosystem resilience
and protecting cultural and  recreational resources from damage or loss. https://www.nps.gov/gate/learn/news/long-term-resource-management-under-a-changing-climate.htm</description>

      <description>Yesterday, firefighters did minimal hand ignitions along the National Park Service W4 Road as the fire progressed slowly to the west. Crews did not conduct firing operations along Forest Road 223 as more prep work is needed before putting additional fire on the ground.  Smoke from the Ikes Fire, along with other fires in the area, will be visible throughout the area and may cause smoke impacts. 

The North Rim Village and businesses at Grand Canyon National Park are OPEN. Temporary trail and road closures for the Ikes Fire Planning Area within Grand Canyon National Park include: Powell Plateau Trail, North Bass Trail, Fire Point, Swamp Point, and the W4 road heading north starting at the intersection of the W4 and W1 roads. https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/ikes-fire-expands-crews-continue-to-meet-objectives-20190821.htm</description>

      <title>Water Conservation Implemented at Grand Canyon National Park Due to Water-System Issues</title>
      <link>https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/water-conservation-june-21.htm</link>
      <description>Grand Canyon National Park is requesting that all visitors and residents on the South Rim of Grand Canyon begin instituting water conservation measures. A break in the Transcanyon Pipeline was identified today; in addition to the breakdown of one of the Indian Garden pipeline water pumps that provide water to the South Rim storage tanks. The combination of these situations has resulted in immediate water conservation guidelines for all consumers on the South Rim.  The North Rim is unaffected by these issues. https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/water-conservation-june-21.htm</description>

      <description>Today’s weather brought higher temperatures, lower relative humidity and gustier winds, which tested containment lines. Late afternoon winds caused four spot fires east of the W-4 Road containment line. A plan was in place in anticipation of the predicted weather and potential spot fires.  Firefighters, aided by engines, responded and are working to contain the spot fires across the W-4 Road and south of the Kanbowbitz Cabin. These challenging weather conditions are expected to continue over the next few days. The fire is now estimated to be 1,550 acres. https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/weather-conditions-challenge-firefighters-on-galahad-fire.htm</description>
