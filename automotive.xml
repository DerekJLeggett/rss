      <title>Mazda’s Logo, Like Its Stable of Cars, Has Evolved Over 100 Years</title>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;2020 hasn’t been totally terrible—among other things, it marked the 100&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of founding of the Toyo Cork Kogyo Company, which we now know as Mazda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jujiro Matsuda was an engineer in Osaka, and in 1920 he came home to Hiroshima to open a new company that manufactured cork. His first logo was a red circle with a broken horizontal line, which Matsuda intended to indicate his desire to contribute to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-2499020 size-content-width" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/Logo-Toyo_Cogyo.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-2499020 size-content-width" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/Logo-Toyo_Cogyo.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyo Kyogo transitioned to manufacture of heavy machinery in 1927, and in 1931 they produced their first vehicle, the Mazda-Go three-wheel truck. The vehicle was named for Ahura Mazda, a Zoroastrian deity whose name literally translates to “god of wisdom,” and whose name had a happy similarity to Matsuda’s own. In 1934, Toyo Kyogo developed a new Mazda logo, though the company did not officially change its name until 1984.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1936, Mazda developed a new logo based on that of its home city. Hiroshima’s logo was three wavy lines against a green background, representing the three flows of the Ota River delta. Mazda took the three lines and reformed them to show a stylized M, and the logo was used right until the late 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-2499044 size-content-width" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/z01_11_1936_021.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-2499044 size-content-width" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/z01_11_1936_021.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;Meanwhile, a new simple “MAZDA” badge was needed for export vehicles, and Mazda developed a block-printed version in 1954. Back in the home market, Mazda was developing its first passenger car, the R360. Mazda developed yet another logo, returning to the 1920 circular motif with an M in the middle, elongated at both ends to meet the circle. For the 1964 Cosmo prototype (as well as the 1967 production Cosmo Sport), Mazda embedded this logo in a rounded triangle, a shape familiar to all Mazda rotary-engine fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2498998" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/DLS0746.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2498998" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/DLS0746.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid-70s, Mazda returned to a name logo using block letters and a stylized Z. It remained in use until 1997 and is perhaps the best known of Mazda’s logos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2499009" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/DLS1003.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2499009" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/DLS1003.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then the whimsical 1990s rolled around, and Mazda decided it needed something more symbolic. The diamond-in-a-rounded-square logo of 1991 was supposed to recall wings and the sun, but what it really recalled was the Renault logo. Mazda rounded its edges in 1992, and this emblem adorned the first-generation Miata, among other cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2499003" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/DLS0898.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2499003" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/DLS0898.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current Mazda badge was developed in 1997, employing a wing-like V that meets a squared circle to form an M shape. It&amp;#8217;s often paired with the block-style lettering that Mazda developed in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2499021" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/Mazda_CX9_logo2__jpg72.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2499021" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/Mazda_CX9_logo2__jpg72.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s next? The current logo is now nearly 25 years old, which means it&amp;#8217;s time for something new. We think Mazda should return to a logo that uses the rotary-engine motif&amp;#8230; and maybe, just maybe, a rotary-engine car to put underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/100-years-of-mazda-logos/"&gt;Mazda&amp;#8217;s Logo, Like Its Stable of Cars, Has Evolved Over 100 Years&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com"&gt;MotorTrend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Build Your Own Roadkill-Style Muscle Truck for the Street or Strip</title>
      <link>https://www.motortrend.com/news/build-muscle-truck-street-strip/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a simple formula really: Take a common American pickup truck, stuff in more power than it deserves, and have fun. Between the Roadkill and Roadkill Garage shows, we have assembled a triple play of fast haulers, appropriately identified as the original (Chevy) “Muscle Truck” the “Mopar Muscle Truck” (MMT) and the “Ford Muscle [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is a simple formula really: Take a common American pickup truck, stuff in more power than it deserves, and have fun. Between the Roadkill and Roadkill Garage shows, we have assembled a triple play of fast haulers, appropriately identified as the original (Chevy) “Muscle Truck” the “Mopar Muscle Truck” (MMT) and the “Ford Muscle Truck” (FMT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490179" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/055-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490179" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/055-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These trucks quickly became fan favorites as a group and individually, and continue to appear in Roadkill related content and at Roadkill events. The common thread is that all are short-bed stepsides from the late 60’s to early 1970s, built for street performance and all-around vehicular mayhem. Aside of their similarities, each of these muscle trucks has its own personality with distinct differences. Each has a different story to tell, and here they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Original “Muscle Truck”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490170" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/012-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490170" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/012-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting it all is the 1974 Chevy C-10 long referred to as simply the “Muscle Truck,” but lately we added “Original” to distinguish it from the others. This truck was around well before the Roadkill Show, built by Freiburger and Chad Reynolds in a very Roadkill-like 15-day thrash to make it to the GM Performance Parts LSx Shootout way back in 2008. Freiburger already had the truck, bought from a Craiglist ad for $1,500 as an unassembled project, complete with multi-colored body panels from several donor vehicles. The plus here was the blasted and powdercoated chassis and suspension. To make it a candidate for the LSx Shootout, Freiburger also had a modified GM Performance Parts LS6 crate engine left over from dyno testing for Hot Rod magazine. Combining this truck and engine gave birth to what became the Roadkill muscle truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The object was low, loud and mean, with modern power via the modified late model LS6 engine. The LS6 was originally the higher-power version of GM’s aluminum LS1 engine found in the Z06 C5 Corvette, and offered as a crate engine from GM with a factory rating of 405 horsepower. Freiburger modified this one with a hotter Crane cam (228/232-degrees duration @ 0.050; 0.600-inch lift) and Crane roller rockers. It an MSD engine management system and ignition, along with a BBK aluminum EFI intake manifold. Freiburger conservatively estimates the output at 475 horsepower. As installed in the truck, the engine’s screaming exhaust note has become famous, but it was actually a fluke – the last minute result of using whatever parts were at hand when the truck was originally built. Included here were mid-length headers, separated dual three-inch pipes stepped-up to meet 4-inch Dynomax Race Bullet mufflers, all terminating with downturns in front of the rear axle. The combination resulted in a shrill shriek that made driving it great and painful at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engine is mated to a full manual valve body Dynamic Racing Transmission’s Turbo 400 automatic trans equipped with a Gear Vendor over/underdrive unit. A 4000 rpm stall Art Carr torque converter is sandwiched in-between the engine and trans. You’ll find a Ford 9-inch rear end salvaged from an F100 perched over the springs, and though it was originally fitted with a spool and 5.13:1 gears, it was re-geared on Roadkill Garage episode 6 with more drivable 3.73:1 gears and a Detroit Locker differential. In that same episode we made other concessions to luxury, adding insulation, carpeting in the cab, a new Pioneer stereo, rear view mirrors, and we finally got the inoperable rear brakes functional. Although these changes might seem to make the truck milder, the violent, shrieking, long-distance burnout ability remains intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overview of the Muscle Truck would not be complete without a description of the suspension and the resulting low-down stance. Originally the truck was equipped with an Air Ride suspension system up front for a total on-the-dirt slam. For simplicity, that setup was recently replaced with coil springs, with CCP lower and Ride Tech upper control arms. The rear has always been leaf springs with Cal Tracs bars for on the track bite. Lowering at the rear is via the previously mentioned axle flip, which works with a “Z” sectioned frame rail for clearance. The whole mess rides on 17×8-inch Cragar Soft 8 wheels at all four corners, running 225 55r-17 front rubber and 31-inch tall 285 60r-17 tires in the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Muscle Truck is by far the most well-known of our trio of trucks. We haven’t counted them, but we suspect this truck has appeared in more MotorTrend shows than any of our other vehicles. Actually, its video glory began before &lt;a href="https://www.motortrendondemand.com/"&gt;MotorTrend videos&lt;/a&gt; were even a thing. What’s next? It is really pretty good the way it is now, but don’t be surprised to see it appear in a future show for who-knows-what mods and hijinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warmed-over LS6 engine under the hood is just a buzz-saw, ripping rpm and making power with ease. Better still, the reliability is amazing – nothing breaks or leaks, and it never lets us down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multi-color exterior look was not by design – it’s because this truck’s body was pieced together using salvaged and replacement panels from different sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little bit of a revamp happened to the interior recently, including sound-deadening, carpeting, and new stereo. The brutal B&amp;#38;M ProShifter and stylish OEM Buick GS steering wheel have been there since the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490175" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/022-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490175" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/022-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the other “muscle trucks” sit high on stock suspension, the original MT hunkers down thanks to custom front a-arms holding 2-inch drop spindles and lowering springs up front, and an axle-over-spring setup at the rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 1974 D100 Mopar Muscle Truck made its debut in episode 15 of Roadkill Garage, where this nearly completed project truck finally hit the road. The backstory on this one actually involves the tale of three similar Dodge trucks, beginning with the Bronze 1977 D100 stepside featured in Roadkill episode 40. I’ve owned that truck since the mid 1990s, and it has been in fairly continuous use since. The drawback to that one is the model year. In California, anything newer than 1975 requires biannual smog inspection, making modification a difficult if not illegal pursuit. Enter the white 1972 D100 fleetside shortbed seen in the background of many episodes of Roadkill Garage and Roadkill Extra. That was built as a replacement for the original 1977 step side solely for it smog exempt status. When a hit and run incident damaged the ’72 fleet, the hunt was on for replacement parts to fix it. That led to the U-Pull Parts yard in Bakersfield, California, where the 1974 D100 stepside now known as the Mopar Muscle Truck was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up on blocks in the salvage yard, the MMT already gave up plenty of parts inside and out. Despite that, a few laps around it showed a real jewel in the rough. The factory paint was remarkably good, the body panels were straight, and the entire truck was amazingly rust free. It didn’t take long to realize that this was a much nicer truck than the &amp;#8217;72 fleetside I was looking to fix. The fact that it was a factory manual shift truck sealed the deal. Some negotiation with the yard had it bought for $900 and it was saved from the crusher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide the pieces to fix all of these trucks, yet another one was acquired just as a parts truck—the black 1975 D100 that was featured as the stripped-out Truck Buggy in episode 3 of Roadkill Garage. That one came in trade for a set of cylinder heads, complete but un-registerable with massive DMV back fees and an ancient bank lien. Many of the parts for the MMT came from this parts truck, including the mint front bumper and grill, radiator, fan shroud, power steering, cowl panel, and an untold number of small parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the MMT, virtually nothing was salvageable except the odd split-back bench seat for use as a core. The cab was stripped to the bare firewall, insulated, carpeted, and the entire dash, instrument panel, wiring, and a factory A/C system were all built from nice used and wrecking yard pieces. The great thing about this era of Dodge truck is that parts are still cheap and plentiful at the junkyard, but we don’t expect that to last. The seat was sent in to a local shop for new upholstery in a very un-Roadkill-like move, but hey, it is a Roadkill Garage project. We have our own rules. Inside the MMT really is “mint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, the 318 engine the truck came with was pulled and replaced with a 360 Mopar small block, I built a few years ago for a feature in the now-defunct Engine Masters magazine. With 10.75:1 compression, a custom Comp solid flat tappet cam, and wild cylinder head and intake manifold porting, the 360 delivered 520 horsepower on the engine dyno. I installed it with Summit long-tube headers leading to a fabricated 3-inch side-hung exhaust using Hooker Aero-Chamber mufflers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the drivetrain was assembled from used, salvaged, or fabricated parts. First, the floor-shifted 3-speed manual transmission that came with the truck was replaced with a junkyard A-833 4-speed overdrive trans using a car bellhousing, a used Centerforce clutch, modified OE clutch linkage, and a used OEM Hurst shifter. Overall, the transmission set-up was cheap, but proved to be not so good. The MMT’s factory 8 ¼ rear originally just got a welded differential as shown in RKG episode 15, but later was replaced by the 8 ¾ from the laid-up 1972 fleetside truck, complete with a 3.55:1 ratio limited-slip differential. Wheels are salvaged old-school slots that were polished and clear-coated; 15×7 front, and 15×10 rear, with 255 60R-15 and 275 60R-15 tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaster struck when the 360 engine developed a pinhole coolant leak in cylinder number 3 during the filming of Roadkill Garage episode 20. A hot 318 was swapped in as a stop-gap as featured in Roadkill Extra episode 240, but later changed in Roadkill Garage Episode 21 to the hottest engine yet, a 408 Magnum with 550 horsepower. In that episode the MMT was taken to the track for a shake-down and promptly proved to have an unshiftable trans, an unstable suspension, and then the differential blew. The MMT is really good, but needs to be perfected – maybe in a future episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the goals in the MMT build was a totally nice interior that retains the factory vibe. Everything inside but the seat upholstery and carpet was built with mint used parts, mostly from junkyard trucks. The instrument panel is the later wraparound style; the metal door panels are usually only found on fleet or early low-line trucks; the factory air system, a/c dash, and controls were all added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490177" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/040-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490177" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/040-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside, the factory paint is not perfect, but still shines. The bumper and grill are nice used pieces from a parts truck to replace the originals. Salvaged slot mags set-off the old school look, and were dirt cheap. The large OEM flag style mirrors remain as a nod to 1970’s utility and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490188" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/007-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490188" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/007-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the hood is a 408 stroker based on a 5.9 Magnum engine. Big valves, expert porting of the heads and intake, a stout custom hydraulic roller comp cam, and nearly 11:1 compression give 550 horsepower as dyno tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490189" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/010-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490189" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/010-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I custom fabbed the rear bumper from a piece of 4x6x0.125 mild steel tubing, following the lower bed contour, and recessing the plate. Work lights are operated by a toggle switch in the dash. The tailgate was bent during the trucks brief stay at the salvage yard, but I found a perfect used one that will eventually replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ford Muscle Truck (FMT)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490187" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/005-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490187" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/005-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hunt was on to find a Ford truck to complete our collection of muscle trucks from the big three domestic manufacturers, and for a cool build show for a Roadkill Garage episode. To keep the common theme, it had to be a shortbed stepside regular cab. We love the mid &amp;#8217;50s Ford trucks, but they cost mega bucks, and don’t really fit in with the others. We also considered the earlier &amp;#8217;60s trucks which are cool, but decided the 1967-1972 Ford “bumpside” had the style, while this same chassis was the basis for the later, very similar, 1973-79 “dentside” trucks. We found that only single digit percentages of Ford truck production over these years featured the stepside (Ford technically called “flareside”) bed, making them pretty rare. We also found that these trucks have already become sought after and therefore they are already expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a Skyview Blue 1968 stepside that looked the part. It already had the bones of a muscle truck, with a swapped in 460 big-block Ford and C6 transmission, a B&amp;#38;M ratchet shifter, and best of all, it looked solid. At an asking price of $4,500, it was definitely outside our normal price range, but looking at the prices these trucks go for, it was actually a bargain—especially with the big-block Ford power. I showed it to Freiburger suggesting that he should get it, but he was lukewarm. He just couldn’t accept the baby blue color, and passed on the deal. I kind of like the soothing robins egg hue, and had a special bond to the 1968 F100 stepside, since my dad had one when I was growing up. That was enough for me to make the buy, and the Ford Muscle Truck (FMT) joined the pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we found out when the Ford Muscle Truck was purchased was that it came with a shady history. The seller disclosed that it was originally built and used as a “bootlegger” truck, running some sort of contraband from Humboldt County in Northern California, down to Central and Southern California. As a sort of modern-day rum-runner, this vehicle was built with numerous special features, besides the powerful big block V8. The free-flowing dual exhaust system uses incredibly quiet mufflers to silence conspicuous engine noise. Tall 3.00:1 rear gears keep the revs down for effortless high-speed, long-distance, cruising. Disc brakes up front bring it down from speed quick and straight every time. The taillights are positioned to be shrouded from view, and incorporate a switch in the cab to make them inoperable. A spotlight was installed on the cowl to “…see locks on gates down dirt roads in the dead of night.” The mock toolbox in the bed houses a hidden auxiliary gas tank for extended cruising range. The list goes on but you get the gist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it might seem that we got the FMT already done, there were problems. The truck had obviously been long retired from its ignoble past, and clearly was not up to its former glory. Even though the cooling system featured a huge aluminum radiator, rust in the water passages had stopped-up the insides. The electrical system was a bird’s nest of wiring disaster. Worst of all, and ancient Holley Pro-Jection throttle body EFI system from the 1980s barely allowed the engine to start and run, so it either idled at 2,000 rpm or stalled. Between the overheating and the EFI, the FMT was basically undrivable, and the butchered wiring was poised to burn the whole rig to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these problems and more were fixed in Roadkill Garage episode 22. A Holley 770 vacuum secondary carb replaced the EFI atop the big Weiand dual-plane intake manifold that was already on the engine. That and an Accel ignition system triggered by a new stock distributor had the big block running like a champ. A Freiburger wiring job under the hood and in the cab eliminated the electrical gremlins. The overheating was solved by flushing the cooling system and adding a giant Derale dual electric fan arrangement. Inside, we added an Autometer three-gauge panel and traditionally-style tach, along with a reproduction Mustang-style wood rimmed steering wheel. Finally, bigger 255 60R-15 and 275 60R-15 tires were installed on Wheel Vintiques Series 62 steel wheels for a beefier look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work on the FMT might not seem like much, but it transformed the truck. The carb, ignition, and cooling system have the big block engine just purring like a kitten and running perfectly when on the throttle. It just runs and drives so nicely the temptation is to just stop here and call it great, but that’s unlikely. We’re already talking about what’s next – like more power from the big 460 engine, bigger wheel and tires, lower suspension…The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 460 Ford big block did not come as factory equipment in trucks until 1974. We were told this 460 swapped into our truck came from a Police Interceptor, but we have not yet checked any of the numbers. With some parts replacement including a Holley carb, the package runs unbelievably well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490185" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/003-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="1024" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490185" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/003-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="1024" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to its nefarious bootlegging past, the Ford Muscle Truck came with numerous unusual accessories and modifications, most of which we decided to keep, including this cop-style spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490182" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/000-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490182" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/000-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the FMT is stylish, comfortable, and functional, thanks to the Mustang wheel, classic style Autometer gauges, ice-cold A/C, and horse-blanket style seat cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490184" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/002-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490184" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/002-Roadkill-Muscle-Truck-Ford-Chevy-Dodge.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the FMT looks pretty good, but I’m itching for more glamour from the wheels, like original American or Cragar SS mags, with wider ones in the back and fatter rear meats. Other items on the fantasy list include a suspension drop keeping the Twin I-Beams, some sort of fabbed rear bumper, and those mirrors will have to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Weird and Wonderful AMC Rambler Marlin Was a Concept Car Come to Life</title>
      <link>https://www.motortrend.com/news/history-amc-rambler-marlin/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Rambler Marlin remains a rare sight in the world of classic cars, but the car’s utterly unique appearance makes them a welcome visitor to any venue.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Rambler Marlin remains a rare sight in the world of classic cars, but the car’s utterly unique appearance makes them a welcome visitor to any venue. Naturally, that time we heard the Marlin Auto Club was holding a “Gathering of Marlins” at the American Motors Owners Association (AMO) International Convention in Rockford, Illinois, we had to check it out. An even 10 Marlins—mostly 1966 models for their 50th anniversary—turned out for the Gathering, and a pre-production Rambler Tarpon clone even dropped by the AMO’s big show the second day. We also got a chance to talk to artist Vince Geraci, head of the American Motors Corporation’s design studio in charge of of the AMC Marlin, who gave a brief presentation on the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490262" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/amc-rambler-marlin-no-pillar.jpg" alt="" width="2040" height="1362" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490262" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/amc-rambler-marlin-no-pillar.jpg" alt="" width="2040" height="1362" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Marlin Prehistory: The Rambler Tarpon Concept&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original concept for the Marlin came in the aerodynamic form of the Rambler Tarpon that debuted at the 1964 Chicago Auto Show, where Richard Teague’s design marked a radical departure from the normally conservative look of Rambler’s and AMC’s offerings. While a bit smaller and lacking some of the refinement of the production Marlin, the Tarpon was essentially the same basic concept: a pillarless coupe that fell somewhere near the personal luxury coupe market. The most striking feature is the sloped fastback roofline that terminates at the rear bumper. That long aerodynamic “teardrop” shape harkened back to mid-century designs like AMC’s predecessor, the Nash Airflyte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490258" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/amc-rambler-marlin-engine.jpg" alt="" width="4608" height="3456" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490258" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/amc-rambler-marlin-engine.jpg" alt="" width="4608" height="3456" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built on a convertible Rambler American, the Rambler Tarpon toured the country on the auto show circuits and came back with favorable enough reactions that AMC president Roy Abernethy greenlit production of the car with a new name, Marlin, for the 1965 model year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490261" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/amc-rambler-marlin-interior.jpg" alt="" width="4608" height="3456" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490261" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/amc-rambler-marlin-interior.jpg" alt="" width="4608" height="3456" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Pony Car Is Born&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Tarpon, the ’65 was built on the Rambler American platform, but the overall design was changed from a 2+2 coupe that might have slotted into the burgeoning “pony car” market to a larger 3+3 family coupe designed to appeal to the market’s trend toward bigger cars with more appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490260" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/amc-rambler-marlin-inside.jpg" alt="" width="2040" height="1366" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490260" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/amc-rambler-marlin-inside.jpg" alt="" width="2040" height="1366" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request for more passenger room was handled in no small part by Geraci and his designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The feedback came that the headroom in back was insufficient,” Geraci said. “They wanted 1.5 inches more of headroom [for the rear seats]; We hated that, thought it took away the sleekness.” Nevertheless, Geraci’s studio went to work on Abernethy’s request for more headroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Designer] Kevin Goodnough disguised that change very well, I think,” Geraci said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490257" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/amc-rambler-marlin-emblem-logo.jpg" alt="" width="3872" height="2592" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490257" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/amc-rambler-marlin-emblem-logo.jpg" alt="" width="3872" height="2592" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AMC Rambler Insignia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small trunk opening on the slanted rear wore an unmistakable glass Marlin insignia badge and the overall appearance was spruced up from the Tarpon, including the addition of a lip to the rear deck, giving just a tiny nod to the design’s borrowed aeronautical elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Marlin’s first two years of production didn’t result in high sales volume, but with the introduction of a new AMC platform in 1967, the Marlin got a redesign on the Ambassador’s wider track width and wheelbase. “[The ’67] was the most attractive Marlin because we were able to get a new package with a new body,” Geracis said. That new body included a redesigned roofline and a smaller C-pillar. The company branding also switched all Rambler badging to AMC in 1967, making the ’67 officially the “AMC Marlin.” Sales struggled with only a few more than 2,000 being sold in 1967 and Marlin production ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490259" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/amc-rambler-marlin-fastback.jpg" alt="" width="3872" height="2592" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490259" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/amc-rambler-marlin-fastback.jpg" alt="" width="3872" height="2592" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even among AMC’s contemporary designers, opinions on the Marlin’s design are a mixed bag. Bob Nixon, who worked for AMC and Jeep for decades, has been quoted calling the Marlin an “ugly embarrassment.” But Geraci still thinks highly of the design and the proof is always in the pudding for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ’65 Marlin is still an attractive car,” he said. “When you take it to a car show, in a sea of 150 Corvettes, people always gravitate toward the Marlin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/history-amc-rambler-marlin/"&gt;The Weird and Wonderful AMC Rambler Marlin Was a Concept Car Come to Life&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com"&gt;MotorTrend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to know that even if you don’t have the financial health often associated with selling a unicorn startup to Google, you can probably at least (someday) afford the replica of your favorite historically significant car. Beyond the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/shelby-cobra-movie-tribute-car-auction-barrett-jackson/"&gt;myriad Shelby Cobra&lt;/a&gt;, GT40, and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/porsche-vision-spyder-concept-photos-details/"&gt;Porsche 550 Spyder&lt;/a&gt; clones that clog your local Cars and Coffee, there’s more esoteric stuff to be copied. From the Ferrari 250 GT (&lt;a href="https://www.gtoengineering.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;GTO Engineering&lt;/a&gt;) to the Lola T70 (&lt;a href="http://broadleyautomotive.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Broadley Automotive&lt;/a&gt;) to the Lotus 11 (&lt;a href="https://westfield-sportscars.co.uk/showroom-brochures/westfield-xi-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Westfield&lt;/a&gt;), there’s a replica of just about anything available at a relatively reasonable cost—including a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/miata/"&gt;new Miata-based&lt;/a&gt; DIY kit for a 1950s Alfa Romeo Grand Prix car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you too can turn your old leaky, greasy, wheezy Mazda roadster into a rather excellent approximation of the Alfa 158/159 that domineered &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/formula-1-2021-rule-changes-top-5-things-to-know/"&gt;Formula 1 between 1938 and 1951&lt;/a&gt;. Other than the obvious excitement that goes along with driving an open-wheeled car, this is a fascinating build, as creating a reasonably priced and well-proportioned racing replica is a tricky endeavor. Most replicars are built on a stripped-down chassis of an existing car, or designed with their own standard chassis with semi-mass production in mind, such as the Shelby Cobra or &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/rare-ford-gt40-found-in-southern-california-garage/"&gt;the GT40&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for prewar racing replicas is significantly smaller, so building a bespoke &amp;#8220;monoposto&amp;#8221; frame/kit is a tough sell. The majority of the monoposto replicas you do see charging around at track days or sitting pretty as garage art are usually enormously expensive one-offs or ultra-low production specials such as the Argentina-based Pur Sang Type 35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the new Tipo 184 comes in. Inspired by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/wheeler-dealers-1991-nissan-300zx-twin-turbo/"&gt;Wheeler Dealers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Master Mechanic&lt;/em&gt; presenter &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://watch.motortrend.com/tv-shows/ant-anstead-master-mechanic/full-episodes/date-with-a-158"&gt;Ant Anstead’s very own homebrew Alfa 158 replica&lt;/a&gt;, the new Miata-based kit is one of the most interesting methods of Miata upcycling we’ve seen thus far. Anstead appears to be the creative and technical force behind this project and the first ten buyers of the kit will get a chance to build their Tipo 184 in a workshop with Anstead overseeing; he is reportedly working on a full Haynes manual of the Tipo 184 for buyers who would rather perform the conversion in the comfort of their own garage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="size-content-width wp-image-2498911 aligncenter" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/Tipo-184-Kit-6.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="size-content-width wp-image-2498911 aligncenter" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/Tipo-184-Kit-6.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, details are still scarce at this point. From the photos available on the barebones website, though, it appears only some of the Miata componentry makes it through the transformation. Looking over a portion of the kit, some of the suspension, brakes, and most of the Mazda&amp;#8217;s powertrain components bolt onto the supplied spaceframe. Once all the mechanical gubbins are sorted, body panels presumably shaped from fiberglass fit flush on the long tubular shape, along with the single leather seat, wood-rimmed steering wheel, and full metal dash plate for the interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the modern Miata guts under the cylindrical body, the Tipo 184 does its best impression of a mid-century race rocket: the supplied wheels are excellent analogs of the multi-spoke Borrani wire wheels, there’s an exposed elongated exhaust header that runs down the side of the car (complete with four semi-cheesy fake exhaust ports), and the brake discs appear to be shrouded with a metal cover aping the finned drums from the original Alfa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already have a tired Miata sitting around your garden shed, the first ten conversion kits on offer are a relative bargain at £7,499, or $10,100 at the time of this writing. More kits will be made available at a later date, with revised pricing and without the opportunity to build your car alongside Anstead. Of course, if you don’t already have a donor car, you’ll need to source your own, but Tipo 184 says it can assist in the process. Which generations of the MX-5 qualify is unclear, but based on the name—184 alludes to the 1.8-liter displacement and the four-cylinders—and a photo of a junked NB on the landing page, we suspect only the NA and NB generation Miatas are eligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this seems like the perfect opportunity to live out your dreams &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/what-is-perfect-driving-position/"&gt;as Juan Manuel Fangio&lt;/a&gt;, register interest on the official Tipo 184 website and keep an eye out for future updates.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chances are that anyone who&amp;#8217;s reading this had available to them at least some kind of ride-on car toy when they were young. We say &amp;#8220;available,&amp;#8221; because often these toys were and are expensive—even some pedal- and kick-powered cars from decades past cost the equivalent of a few hundred bucks today. But the ultimate, at least for kids growing up in the later half of the 20th century and on, would be a powered ride-on toy. Power Wheels are just so common, though, and who wants just any faceless go-kart? No, the pinnacle of kid transportation has to be a lifelike, miniature re-creation of the hottest cars on sale—like this &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/1988-lamborghini-countach-5000qv-1993-ferrari-512-testarossa/"&gt;Ferrari Testarossa&lt;/a&gt; Junior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were a kid in 1987, and one of these glinted at you from a parking spot near the Christmas tree, consider us jealous. Indeed, a mini Ferrari with all the bells and whistles surely is one of the most decadent children&amp;#8217;s toys ever. Sold by Agostini toys, an Italian company, the Testarossa Junior came with a radio, functioning pop-up headlights (!), radial tires, and a real Momo steering wheel. The rear disc brakes were hydraulic, and a Briggs &amp;#38; Stratton gas engine sat beneath the rear deck. Power levels varied—we&amp;#8217;ve seen 8 hp listed in some places, 11 in others—but what counts is that this roughly 2/3-scale Ferrari was capable of serious (scale) speed. Rich kids could whip it up to 30 mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richie Rich would sit in real leather chairs, working the rack and pinion steering via that hot Momo wheel, and probably feel like a total boss. The little Ferrari had a four-corner double wishbone suspension, forward and reverse gears, and a racy tube frame chassis with fiberglass bodywork. Even the wheels are lifelike Ferrari five-spokers, cast from aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The era in which this Ferrari Testarossa Junior was offered was chock full of absurd miniature re-creations, many of which were still available well into the ’90s. Agostini appears to have also offered a Ferrari 308, Porsche 911, and Lamborghini Countach of similar quality. This author remembers lusting after an R129 Mercedes-Benz SL in an F.A.O. Schwartz catalog, as well as a Land Rover Range Rover go-kart in the same publication. The Testarossa Junior was offered for sale in the same forums, said to have landed in both the F.A.O. and Neiman Marcus catalogs; three appear to have been sold through Harrods of London, too. All were sold at insane prices—like close to $50,000 crazy—and occasionally today they come up for auction (&lt;a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22723/lot/269/?category=list"&gt;like this one at a since-passed Bonhams sale&lt;/a&gt;) and sell for even more. Okay, so maybe a Power Wheels Jeep ain&amp;#8217;t the worst thing in the world … especially since it probably won&amp;#8217;t bankrupt your family.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Little Tikes Cozy Coupe: First “Car” for Many Has Roots In Real Car World</title>
      <link>https://www.motortrend.com/news/little-tikes-cozy-coupe-history/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The holidays get us thinking about toys, and when car people think about toys, a few things are bound to come up. Hot Wheels and Matchbox, sure—maybe even Micro Machines.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The holidays get us thinking about toys, and when car people think about toys, a few things are bound to come up. &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/expensive-hot-wheels-ever/"&gt;Hot Wheels&lt;/a&gt; and Matchbox, sure—maybe even &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/micro-machines-book-history-photos-details/"&gt;Micro Machines&lt;/a&gt;. But for a younger (and broader) set of kiddos, the Little Tikes Cozy Coupe might have been the first car in their life. Maybe it was in yours. It’s not possible to quantify the impact these early car toys had on budding enthusiast psyches, but we can peek into the origin and evolution of this timeless kick-powered toy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Its iconic shape isn’t merely friendly and aesthetically pleasing—it’s also far more clever than it would first appear. The original Cozy Coupe prototype was the brainchild of Jim Mariol, a designer who had a stint in auto design. There’s a &lt;a href="https://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/recent_features/cozycoupe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fantastic profile of Mariol&lt;/a&gt; by the University of Cincinnati, of which he was an alum, that details his career—and a &lt;a href="https://www.hemmings.com/stories/2020/01/16/jim-mariol-designed-the-worlds-best-selling-car-beloved-by-toddlers-for-40-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;closer look at his career in the auto industry&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;em&gt;Hemmings&lt;/em&gt;. But we’re interested in his later design work for Little Tikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2498781" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/cozy_coupe_prototype.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2498781" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/cozy_coupe_prototype.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The most clever part was the overall conception: a pedal-car-like experience without the pedals, called a foot-to-floor toy. Something kids too little for pedal cars could also enjoy without excluding older kids who could also fit inside. Mariol was inspired scooting around on a wheeled office chair, using his feet—something within the power of an average little tyke. The design was more than just cute: The roof made it, indeed, cozy and more like a real car than a typical roofless pedal car. And the larger rear wheels and bulkier rear end meant it would be harder to tip over backwards. Add in the long, swoopy door, which of course opens, and you have a primeval car experience, delivered to Little Tikes for consideration in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Mariol told UC he did more than merely design the car, also performing all the engineering involved in the prototype (pictured above). But there was one big change to be made before production: The black roof had to go. While it might have been more true to the vinyl-clad roofs of its era, it lacked a certain whimsy. Little Tikes accepted the overall design enthusiastically, but for production a yellow roof took the place of a black one. A classic was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The original Cozy Coupe features slender A-pillars in black, a decal emulating square sealed-beam headlights, and a little “trunk” out back. It’s no sports car, but the visibility afforded by its ample greenhouse is peerless. By the early 1990s, the Cozy Coupe was selling briskly enough to be called “the bestselling car in America.” More than 10 million units have been sold worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2498783" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/1991-2.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:747" alt="" width="660" height="747" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2498783" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/1991-2.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:747" alt="" width="660" height="747" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Not that the Cozy Coupe hasn’t changed with the times. In 1991, it was tweaked slightly—the A-pillars changed to yellow, the molded seat design was altered, and the black wheels became white. The fundamental Cozy Coupe idea didn’t get a serious revision until 2003, when its roof shrank while the A-pillars grew significantly. The proportions changed, too, with larger front wheels hoisting that end higher off the ground. Round headlight decals gave it a friendlier, almost anthropomorphic face—a foreshadowing of what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2498784" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/Cozy-Coupe-30th-Ann.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:830" alt="" width="660" height="830" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2498784" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/Cozy-Coupe-30th-Ann.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:830" alt="" width="660" height="830" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;In 2009, the Cozy Coupe sprouted eyes. At first, they were conjoined before being separated a few years later. A response to a certain 2006 Pixar film involving anthropomorphic cars, perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2498785" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/Cozy-Coupe-Newest.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="488" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2498785" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/Cozy-Coupe-Newest.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="488" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Both the 2009 and the 2017+ versions are certainly friendly and fun, but they represent a different idea of a toy than the original. This is a friendly companion rather than an adorable conveyance—not better or worse, but a new approach. Exactly what decade in its 40-odd-year history the Cozy Coupe imprinted itself on your consciousness may determine how divergent the current model is from your ideal—but every iteration is an icon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/little-tikes-cozy-coupe-history/"&gt;Little Tikes Cozy Coupe: First “Car” for Many Has Roots In Real Car World&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com"&gt;MotorTrend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Sterling 825: A Pseudo Honda and One of the Worst Cars in History</title>
      <link>https://www.motortrend.com/news/terrible-cars-really-terrible-sterling-825-827/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some &amp;#8220;terrible&amp;#8221; cars weren’t actually terrible, and rides like the AMC Gremlin and Ford Mustang II have an undeservedly reputation for being bad. But some terrible cars truly do deserve every ounce of scorn sent their way, including the ill-fated Anglo-Japanese mashup at the center of this piece, the Sterling 825.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some &amp;#8220;terrible&amp;#8221; cars weren’t actually terrible, and rides like the AMC Gremlin and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/happy-40th-birthday-ford-mustang-ii-is-an-unsung-hero-wvideo-407845/"&gt;Ford Mustang II&lt;/a&gt; have an undeservedly reputation for being bad. But some terrible cars truly do deserve every ounce of scorn sent their way, including the ill-fated Anglo-Japanese mashup at the center of this piece, the Sterling 825. It was a car that had every opportunity to be great, but turned out to be one of the worst cars ever sold in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honda and Rover—an Unlikely Partnership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1980s, the Austin-Rover Group—refugee from the wreckage of British Leyland—had found some success in its home market by selling rebadged Hondas, first as the Triumph Acclaim and later as the Rover 200. ARG needed a replacement for the aging &lt;a href="https://www.automobilemag.com/news/autp-0704-1980-land-rover-3500-sd1-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;full-size Rover SD1&lt;/a&gt;, and was itching to get back into the American market. The timing was perfect: Reagan and Thatcher were BFFs and Charles and Di’s wedding had charmed America, a country developing a taste for European luxury cars. Jaguar sales were picking up, so why couldn’t Austin-Rover enjoy the same success?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Honda was facing voluntary quotas in the U.S. market and needed to improve profitability. It saw a big luxury sedan as the way to do that. Together, Honda and Austin-Rover embarked on a project that would produce the Acura Legend and the Rover 800, the latter of which would be sold in the U.S. under a new marque: Sterling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acura Legend and Sterling 825: Go Your Own Way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honda and Austin-Rover weren’t looking to build a badge-engineered vehicle; instead they collaborated on behind-the-scenes components and individualized the cars as needed. Honda developed the powertrain; ARG engineered the structure and suspension. The body-in-white, powertrain, driveline, seat frames, climate control, and other such parts were shared, but when it came to suspension tuning, sheetmetal, and interior design, the two companies went their separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other things, that meant that each company was responsible for its own electrical system. If you know anything about British cars, you don’t need to read any further to know how this story ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2497240" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/11/2020/07/Rover_800_02.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2497240" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/11/2020/07/Rover_800_02.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honda launched the Acura Legend for the 1986 model year, and the reception was predictably favorable. American buyers who had developed a taste for Japanese quality and efficiency loved the car. The newly formed ARCONA (Austin-Rover Corporation of North America, the official importer for the Sterling) expected similar success for the Sterling, and why not? After all, the Legend and the Sterling were the same car. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A British-Built Car Made Like a Honda?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACRONA gleefully told an understandably skeptical press that ARG’s plant in Cowley, England, could produce the same quality as Honda, and in fact would build Legends and Sterlings side-by-side. The January 1987 issue of our sister publication &lt;em&gt;Automobile&lt;/em&gt; featured as part of its Sterling review a two-page spread espousing the factory’s robotized body assembly line and the thorough battery of quality checks and tests to which each example would be subjected. Even editor-in-chief and journalist icon David E. Davis Jr. took the bait, writing that “Legend and Sterling are built on the same assembly lines and enjoy identical levels of quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that wasn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the whole story. While European-market Legends were indeed built at Cowley—with a Honda-designed electrical system, mind you—those Legends bound for quality-obsessed America were made in Japan. Clearly, Honda wasn’t taking any chances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Promising Start for a Terrible Car&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though European journalists were measured in their praise of the Rover 800, the Sterling 825 saw more favorable reviews in the States, where it was seen as an Acura Legend with a much-needed dose of personality. Reviewers liked the Connolly leather and the burled-walnut trim and the British-tuned handling. At first, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with new-model launches is that we only get a few days (or sometimes a few hours) with the car. &lt;em&gt;Automobile&lt;/em&gt; staffers of yore were understandably wary of British quality, so they ordered a Sterling 825SL for a long-term evaluation. What they learned was that just as the sun once never set on the British Empire, it still didn’t set on badly built English cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the hindsight of history, we know what happened: Despite ARG’s and ARCONA’s promises, quality was abysmal. It was almost amazing that two cars so similar in lineage could be so far apart in execution, and yet there it was: The Acura Legend shot up to the top of J.D. Power’s quality surveys, while the Sterling 825 sat near the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just How Bad Was the Sterling 825?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you think we’re exaggerating, here’s a list of the problems that &lt;i&gt;Automobile&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8216;s long-term Sterling 825 had addressed over the course of its &lt;em&gt;nine &lt;/em&gt;dealership visits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2,321 miles: Fuel gauge broken, glove box sticking, steering wheel off center, cruise control inaccurate, door molding adrift, coolant warning light flashing, tires out of balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3,751 miles: Windshield leaking, fuel gauge working but incorrect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6,544 miles: Sunroof not opening, windshield washers not working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7,006 miles: Dashboard light and passenger seat lumbar support broken, fuel gauge incorrect (2nd time), trunk trim loose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7,609 miles: Driver seat adjustment not working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8,886 miles: Coolant and fuel gauges not working (again), driver seat lumbar and power mirror switch inoperative, brake warning light stuck on, passenger seat belt not retracting, steering wheel off center, grille falling off, fuse box door falling open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15,769 miles: Hood and trunk releases stuck, passenger seat belt not retracting (2nd time), heater button fallen off, passenger lumbar support not working (again), key-in-ignition chime intermittent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17,565 miles: Sunroof not opening (again), coolant gauge faulty (again), fuel gauge faulty (5th time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24,508 miles: Sunroof, coolant gauge, fuel gauge inoperative (3rd, 3rd and 6th time, respectively), ignition key sticking, ashtray sticking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2497242" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/11/2020/07/Sterling_825_brochure_02-1.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2497242" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/11/2020/07/Sterling_825_brochure_02-1.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were only the problems that the magazine bothered to have fixed. There were others: The burled walnut trim developed an eight-inch crack above the glovebox and a six-inch split behind the gear lever. The shifter knob came loose three times. The stereo’s volume went from a reasonable 60 decibels to an ear-bleed-inducing 120 dB with a mere quarter-inch turn. The trunk release required both hands to pull. The body cladding behind the rear wheels worked its way loose on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plastic cover housing the emergency crank for the sunroof fell off twice, coincidentally the same number of times that the plastic housing for the rear center-mounted brake light came off. The cruise control selected speeds 8 to 10 mph different from its setting, and using two electric windows at the same time caused the engine speed to drop 500 rpm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writer John Phillips, the author of the wrap-up story, called this auxiliary list “a variety of maladies that nobody had the energy or enthusiasm to tackle.” Though the Sterling never stranded anyone, by year’s end staffers were refusing to take it on long out-of-state trips. By Phillips’s estimation, the fuel gauge was inoperative for six of the twelve months &lt;em&gt;Automobile&lt;/em&gt; had the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…And It Wasn’t Just Them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That experience was not unique. Before it learned about the litany of failures, an ARG spokesman reported “line fixes” to a variety of components that nearly matched &lt;em&gt;Automobile&lt;/em&gt;’s repair list word-for-word, most of which were implemented for late-1987 and later cars. ARG was desperately trying to save the car’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that the driving experience in a Sterling is practically perfect,” an executive (who asked not to be named) told &lt;em&gt;Automobile &lt;/em&gt;at the time. “It’s a fun car to drive. But that’s quite separate from the ownership experience, and it’s quite separate from our own service record. I hope it’s not too late to prove ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was too late. Sterling resale values plummeted, and so did sales. Sterling sold 14,171 cars in 1987, while Acura moved 54,713 Legends. In 1988, Legend sales rose to nearly 71,000, while Sterling sales dropped to 8,901. In 1989, Sterling introduced the new 827 model, denoting a bigger 2.7-liter V-6, but sales continued to shrink. For 1990, the $23,300 Sterling 827 was offered with a $6,000 cash back offer, possibly the biggest rebate ever offered on a car to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But quality wasn’t improving enough to make a difference, and now the Sterling was facing new, high-quality competition from &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/"&gt;Lexus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/"&gt;Infiniti&lt;/a&gt;. Sterling sold just 4,015 827s in 1990. In August, 1991, the recently-renamed Rover Group announced that it was killing off the Sterling marque in the United States. Few Sterlings of any stripe remain, though true sadists &lt;a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1989-sterling-827-sli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;can occasionally&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bringatrailer.com/2014/09/02/nicest-one-left-1989-sterling-827-sli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;find one&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bringatrailer.com/2018/11/22/part-rover-part-honda-all-rare-1991-sterling-827si-v6-5-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;at auction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sun Never Sets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it wasn’t all dark days for English cars. In the same January 1987 issue in which &lt;em&gt;Automobile&lt;/em&gt; first tested the Sterling 825, it tried out another British vehicle, &lt;a href="https://www.automobilemag.com/news/land-rover-range-rover-classic-reborn-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Range Rover&lt;/a&gt;, which after years of gray-market import was officially coming to the States. (At the time, Land Rover and ARG were independent divisions of the Rover Group.) We all know how that worked out. Quality issues would continue to plague English cars, of course, but never to the level of the disastrous Sterling 825.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaguar and Land Rover quality was always far from perfect, but those brands never suffered the ignoble fate of Sterling. Why? Perhaps people just expect British cars to be badly built, and the Honda connection meant the public had unnecessarily high hopes for the Sterling. But that same connection should have made the Sterling 825 great—and instead it turned out to be one of the most terrible cars ever sold in America.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daewoo’s Epic Flop Wasn’t the End for Its Cars</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember Daewoo? The third South Korean automaker snuck quietly onto the American scene in 1998, with three models and a sales plan that involved college students hawking the cars, Avon-style, to their friends.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Remember Daewoo? The third South Korean automaker snuck quietly onto the American scene in 1998, with three models and a sales plan that involved college students hawking the cars, Avon-style, to their friends. So what ever happened to Daewoo? The dealers disappeared in 2002, but their cars are still very much of a presence here in the U.S. Here&amp;#8217;s what happened, and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The New Daewoos Are in Early This Year&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daewoo certainly got an auspicious start. While Hyundai and Kia both started with a single model (the Excel and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/sportage/"&gt;Sportage&lt;/a&gt;, respectively), Daewoo started with a comprehensive lineup of three. The entry-level Lanos was available as both a two-door hatch or a four-door sedan, powered by a 105-hp 1.6-liter engine. With power steering, antilock brakes, power windows and power locks as standard, it was a good buy for $8,900. The compact Nubira came as a sedan, wagon and a short-lived, bizarre-looking hatchback, Like the Lanos it was quite lavishly equipped for its $12,000 price. Power came from 129-hp, 2.0-liter engine available with a stick or a four-speed automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top of the lineup was the Giugiaro-penned Leganza, its name a portmanteau of the Italian words &lt;em&gt;elegante &lt;/em&gt;(elegant) and &lt;em&gt;forza &lt;/em&gt;(power), neither of which really applied to the car. But it was brisk enough with its 131-hp, 2.2-liter engine. Four-wheel discs, a stick shift, A/C and a 100-watt premium stereo were standard, and a full leather interior was optional, making it a viable Camry alternative at a rock-bottom $15,000 price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Daewoo Gets Educated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three were just-okay cars, a hodgepodge of mechanical parts from Holden and Opel, General Motors’ Australian and European bureaus. (GM at the time had a stake in Daewoo, and the 1988-94 Pontiac LeMans was an Opel Kadett assembled in Korea by Daewoo.) But Daewoo had an innovative idea for selling them, using college student “campus advisers” who got a $300-$500 commission on each lead that turned into a sale. These advisors got a free trip to Seoul for training, use of a car for 90 days, and a 50 percent discount off the sticker price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales were slow, though, and it shouldn’t come as a big surprise that more than half of the cars sold in those first few months were bought by the campus advisors themselves. The students later filed a class-action lawsuit against Daewoo; not only did they have to pay sales tax on the full sticker price, but they were surprised to learn that the 50 percent discount was reported as income to the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student uprisings aside, Daewoo didn’t last long: Their U.S. foray corresponded with the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. Daewoo Motors soon found itself in trouble, and in 1999 the car division was sold off to General Motors and reorganized as GM Daewoo and later GM Korea. Daewoo sales never took off in the States, and their American experiment was halted in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Daewoo&amp;#8217;s Absurd Afterlife: The Chevy/Suzuki Era&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what of the cars? Though Daewoo gave up on the U.S., the cars lived a lot longer than you might expect—even here in the States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production of the Lanos ceased in 2002, but GM continued to sell the car in knocked-down kit form to developing markets and third-world nations. As of 2020 you can still buy a Lanos in Egypt, though it’s now labeled as a Chevrolet. Meanwhile, GM Daewoo&amp;#8217;s replacement for the Lanos, the Kalos, was available stateside as &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/aveo/"&gt;the thoroughly-awful Chevrolet Aveo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nubura was redesigned after Daewoo’s 2002 retreat as the Daewoo Lacetti, though that was just one of many monikers it wore. Fans of &lt;a href="https://www.motortrendondemand.com/show/top-gear/524/"&gt;classic Top Gear&lt;/a&gt; will recognize the Lacetti as one of the show’s Reasonably Priced Car stars. In 2004, the Lacetti came to Stateside Suzuki dealerships, where it as known as the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/suzuki/forenza/"&gt;Forenza&lt;/a&gt; in sedan and wagon form and the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/suzuki/reno/"&gt;Reno&lt;/a&gt; as a (more conventional than the original) four-door hatchback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Leganza’s return was a bit more bizarre: It too was refashioned as the Daewoo Magnus, and those ingenious Koreans managed to shoehorn a 2.5-liter inline six-cylinder engine &lt;em&gt;sideways&lt;/em&gt; between the car’s front wheels. Still playing up its Italian heritage, the car was brought to the States as t&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/suzuki/verona/2004/2004-suzuki-verona/"&gt;he Suzuki Verona&lt;/a&gt;. A colleague who reviewed it told me it reminded him less of Verona, Italy, and more of Verona, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Daewoos did well for Suzuki; the brand topped 100,000 U.S. sales for the first time in 2006, and the Forenza, Reno, and Verona must have played some part in that, no matter how small. But Suzuki sales fell off a cliff during the 2008 economic downturn. The cars disappeared, and so did the Suzuki brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Daewoo Is Coming From Inside the House&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Daewoo is not gone from the U.S.—not by a long shot. GM Daewoo became GM Korea in 2011, and it plays a significant role in General Motors engineering, perhaps a bigger role than GM would like to let on to the gung-ho buy-American section of its buyer base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, GM Korea handles the bulk of engineering for GM’s smaller vehicles. The &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/spark/"&gt;Chevrolet Spark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/sonic/"&gt;about-to-be-discontinued Sonic&lt;/a&gt; are GM Korea designs, as are &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/encore/"&gt;the Buick Encore&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/encore-gx/2020/"&gt;Encore GX&lt;/a&gt;), and Chevrolet’s &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/trax/"&gt;Trax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/trailblazer/"&gt;Trailblazer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/bolt-ev/"&gt;Bolt EV&lt;/a&gt;? Yep, that’s a Daewoo, too—in fact, GM has &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/gm-gigafactory-lordsrown-details/"&gt;partnered with Korea-based LG Chem for the Ultim Cells battery system&lt;/a&gt;, which will power the upcoming &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2022-gmc-hummer-ev-pickup-first-look-review/"&gt;GMC Hummer EV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, Daewoo built other types of vehicles as well, and those divisions has been scattered to the winds. The truck division was sold to Indian automaker Tata in 2004, and &lt;a href="http://www.tata-daewoo.com/eng_new/main/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Tata-Daewoo&lt;/a&gt; is now the second-largest truck producer in South Korea. Daewoo’s bus business was spun off into &lt;a href="http://www.daewoobus.com/newsite/HTML/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Zyle Daewoo Commercial Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, and sells buses in Korea and several developing markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still want a Daewoo? Travel to South Korea and you can find plenty. Or you could just &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/trailblazer/2021/2021-chevrolet-trailblazer-first-drive-review/"&gt;buy a Chevrolet Trailblazer&lt;/a&gt;. Sorry, though—no 50 percent student discounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/daewoo-cars-history-chevrolet-gm-korea/"&gt;Daewoo&amp;#8217;s Epic Flop Wasn&amp;#8217;t the End for Its Cars&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com"&gt;MotorTrend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/lamborghini-jalpa-history-generations-specifications/"&gt;The Lamborghini Jalpa Is a Forgotten Lambo Supercar&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com"&gt;MotorTrend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Lamborghini Jalpa Essential History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the myopia of popular car culture, the Countach wasn’t the only Lamborghini produced in the 1980s. Even with the public’s overwhelming fixation on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/exotic-escape-a-lamborghini-countach-and-ferrari-f40-can-cure-the-blues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lambo’s superstar V-12 wedge&lt;/a&gt;, a small number of V-8–powered mid-engine sports cars were sold alongside the bigger, badder, and significantly more expensive Countach. They don’t get nearly as much attention then, either, but compared to the rarer and even lesser-known Urraco and Silhouette, the Lamborghini Jalpa, produced between 1981 and 1988, was the most popular entry-level Lamborghini until the Gallardo’s arrival in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stylistically, the Bertone-designed Jalpa is very much an evolution of the earlier Silhouette, incorporating the Silhouette’s transverse mid-engine design and its ultra-angular profile. Additionally, Lamborghini offered the Jalpa exclusively as a targa-roofed model, unlike the Countach, which never officially had its roof chopped from the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power comes from a carbureted 3.5-liter DOHC V-8, capable of 255 horsepower and 225 pound-feet of torque—an output not too bad for the era, and roughly comparable to the contemporary Ferrari 308. Shift the five-speed manual transmission quickly, and it’ll run a zero-to-60-mph sprint in around six seconds, on its way to a top speed of 155 mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even compared to Ferrari at the time, Lamborghini was still a very, very small player in the global auto market, and the Jalpa’s total production run of just 410 units reinforces this. As the 1980s progressed, sales of the Jalpa tapered off significantly, causing Lamborghini to cut production after 1988. This would be the final entry-level Lambo until the Gallardo, and the final &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/lamborghini/urus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;V-8–powered Lamborghini until the current Urus SUV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2495436" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/11/2020/08/1986-Lamborghini-Jalpa-_1.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2495436" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/11/2020/08/1986-Lamborghini-Jalpa-_1.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lamborghini Jalpa Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this era of supercar saturation and keyboard-pounding experts, it’s reasonably difficult to stump the crowd at Cars and Coffee with something from a brand as well known as Lamborghini, but we reckon rolling up in a Jalpa should have more than a few supercar kids scratching their heads. You simply don’t see the Jalpa cruising around as much as you do some of the even rarer supercars of the era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for this, chief among them being a distinct lack of buzz for the Jalpa among collectors. As a result, cars in need of major repairs run the risk of being parked and neglected, so there are likely far fewer than the original 400-ish cars remaining in operating condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, both the performance and the driving experience don’t really mesh well with the Jalpa’s troublesome upkeep, so only the truly devout need apply. Our advice? If you are considering a Jalpa due to the relatively low buy-in compared to the Countach and all you’re looking for is a vintage Lamborghini experience, move on. Save your pennies for a low-spec Diablo or stretch for a Countach—the Jalpa just isn’t worth the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re genuinely interested in the Jalpa—which, who can blame you, there aren’t many V-8 Lambos out there—it might be the perfect Countach alternative. Just don’t come crying when it spends more time in the shop than on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2495438" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/11/2020/08/1985-Lamborghini-Jalpa-_3.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2495438" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/11/2020/08/1985-Lamborghini-Jalpa-_3.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lamborghini Jalpa Buying Tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you’ve likely gleaned from our advice above, you need to approach Jalpa ownership with a clear head. Your first issue will be parts availability, though Lamborghini’s relatively new Polo Storico classics division should be able to help you out, provided you have the deepest of pockets. If you don’t have enough cash lying around to buy three or four Jalpas outright, you might have to brave forums and enthusiast clubs to find secondhand components, and then you’re at the mercy of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this hasn’t scared you off yet, we advise to be patient and find a clean, well-maintained example that comes with a thick sheaf of repair bills and shop receipts. Resist the trap of the cheap Jalpa—it will only cost you more in the long run. We say this about nearly every vintage car, but we highly, &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; suggest taking any potential Jalpa to a brand specialist—preferably one with extensive classic Lamborghini expertise—for a pre-purchase inspection and shakedown so you know what you’re dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jalpas aren’t exactly a dime a dozen, but there are usually more than a few chances each year to pick up a clean example at auction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What Lamborghini was in Rocky IV?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;ZJ / WJ Jeep Grand Cherokee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the most popular suggestion sent our way was to take a look at both the ZJ and WJ generations of the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/grand-cherokee/"&gt;Jeep Grand Cherokee&lt;/a&gt;. The ZJ represents the first generation of Jeep’s full-size SUV, which embiggened the unibody construction and looks of the popular XJ Cherokee but added numerous creature comforts as well as an available 5.2-liter V-8 engine on top of the slow, but trusty 4.0-liter inline six. It also offered solid axles front and rear, along with several different four-wheel drive systems and, eventually, a larger 5.9-liter V-8 in the last year of its 1993-1998 production run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WJ was the next step after the ZJ, and delivered essentially the same package matched with revised styling and according to Jeep, only 127 shared components. Offered from 1999 to 2004, WJ Grand Cherokee introduced a new 4.7-liter V-8 in place of the previous eight-cylinder options (in both regular and HO versions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="kaltura-video" data-player="" itemscope="video" itemtype="//schema.org/VideoObject"&gt;&lt;div class="kaltura-lazy-widget" data-lazy-widget&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;div id="kaltura-video-5b2b3-160902321603860" data-kaltura-video="0_v1rawjkv"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;meta itemprop="name" content="MT Trivia: Stump MotorTrend with Angus and Jonny"&gt;&lt;meta itemprop="description" content="Sure, everyone knows the Jeep Wrangler evolved from the WW II-era Willys—but what about real, obscure 4X4 trivia? With questions sourced from the MotorTrendstaff—and each other—we put Jonny Lieberman and Angus MacKenzie to the test."&gt;&lt;meta itemprop="thumbnailURL" content="http://cfvod.kaltura.com/p/1807801/sp/180780100/thumbnail/entry_id/0_v1rawjkv/version/100012"&gt;&lt;meta itemprop="contentURL" content="http://cfvod.kaltura.com/pd/p/1807801/sp/180780100/serveFlavor/entryId/0_v1rawjkv/v/2/ev/7/flavorId/0_7sgqw4q3/name/a.mp4"&gt;&lt;meta itemprop="duration" content="T1320S"&gt;&lt;meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2020-05-20"&gt;&lt;meta itemprop="dateModified" content="2020-05-20"&gt;&lt;meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2020-05-20"&gt;&lt;meta itemprop="height" content="1080"&gt;&lt;meta itemprop="width" content="1920"&gt;&lt;meta itemprop="genre" content="Video"&gt;&lt;meta itemprop="playerType" content="Flash"&gt;&lt;meta itemprop="requiresSubscription" content="No"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stock form both the ZJ and WJ are fairly capable for mild off-roading, but you’ll need to add a lift to fit enough tire underneath to deal with more serious stuff. Keep in mind that if you go too far past four inches of extra suspension you may be looking at additional modifications (such as longer control arms and/or driveshafts) to maintain handling, steering, and stability due to the SUV’s four-corner coil spring design. ZJ trucks outfitted with the Quadra-Trac four-wheel drive system featured a viscous coupling in the NP249 transfer case that did not offer true locking capability when shifted into low-range – and you should definitely avoid buying one of the WJ “all-wheel drive” Grand Cherokees that didn’t feature low-range at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZJs and WJs are cheap, but there’s a reason. Most of the early ZJs are pretty used up at this point, and the WJ trucks introduced a lot of high-end luxury features that don’t have the best reputation for reliability. This is especially true of things like climate control systems (specifically the blend doors), window regulators, and sensors (cam position). Find a barebones Grand Cherokee like an SE or a Laredo that lived its life as a commuter if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/chevrolet-blazer-vs-isuzu-trooper-vs-land-rover-discovery/"&gt;Isuzu Trooper&lt;/a&gt; (or the Subaru/Isuzu Bighorn, Acura SLX, Open Monterey, Holden Jackaroo, depending on where you happen to live) is a two-generation body-on-frame mid-size SUV found in both two-door and four-door body styles. The Trooper was built between 1981 and 2002, and was offered in a wide ranger of trims and models, so there’s a bunch of variations to choose from out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for the best marriage of cheapness and durability, aim for the ’92 and up models, which feature 12-bolt rears and 10-bolt front differentials, as well as an up-sized V-6 checking in at either 3.2 or 3.5 liters, depending on the year. You can fit 32-inch tires underneath the truck without a lift, and while it does offer an independent front suspension it’s still a rugged design that will take a decent amount of abuse. Trucks with a manual transmission feature an integrated low-range transfer case, while automatics offer a divorced setup, and you might want to add a locking front differential and skid plates before tackling more serious trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2492914" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/international_scout_800a_traveltop_2.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2492914" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/12/international_scout_800a_traveltop_2.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;International-Harvester Scout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, they are old. Yes, they aren’t exactly known for their ability to resist the tin worm, which makes them fairly rare outside of the southwestern stronghold of rust-free classics. Still, if you’re in an area where people are still daily-driving rigs from the &amp;#8217;60s and &amp;#8217;70s, the International Scout and Scout II are dead simple, and extremely capable off-roaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things to keep in mind: the original Scout 80 (built between 1960 and 1965, and succeeded by the Scout 800) is, well, about as agricultural as you’d expect from a manufacturer of farm implements, which makes it a little less pleasant to drive to the trail. The Scout II (1971-1980) came in longer-wheelbase models in addition to the standard edition, and also offered Dana 44 axles and Dana 300 transfer cases. Engine parts are hard to find for the latter’s 345 cubic inch V-8 engine, but a number of different transmissions can be made to fit behind the lump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-1145006" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2015/01/2006-Mitsubishi-Montero-left-front-1.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:413" alt="" width="660" height="413" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-1145006" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2015/01/2006-Mitsubishi-Montero-left-front-1.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:413" alt="" width="660" height="413" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mitsubishi Montero&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known as the Pajero outside of North American (and occasionally, the Dodge Raider &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; of the U.S.), the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/mitsubishi-europe-pajero-suv-news-report/"&gt;Mitsubishi Montero&lt;/a&gt; is serious business. Originally offered as a two-door when first introduced in the &amp;#8217;80s, and leaving the market as a four-door by the mid-2000s, the Montero can handle 33-inch tires without a lift and features a selectable locking rear diff to go with its low-range four-wheel drive from 1992-2001. The truck can also be found with a reasonably powerful V-6, particularly after 1997 when it swapped from a 3.0-liter to a 3.5-liter unit. If you need any more convincing, Mitsubishi made the Pajero/Montero its weapon of choice for winning the Paris-to-Dakar desert rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside to Montero (or Raider) ownership? There’s not much of an aftermarket for the truck out there as compared to its contemporaries like the Trooper and the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2021-toyota-land-cruiser-heritage-edition-details-photos/"&gt;Toyota Land Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll also want to aim for pre-2001 models with their full frame design as opposed to the more fragile unibody SUVs that followed for the third generation from Mitsubishi (which also lost its live rear axle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2429144" src="https://st.motortrend.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/ten-shared/assets/images/_.gif" data-lazy="1" data-base="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/11/2020/04/Geo-Tracker-2.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-content-width wp-image-2429144" src="https://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/11/2020/04/Geo-Tracker-2.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;#38;fit=around|660:371" alt="" width="660" height="371" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Geo Tracker / Suzuki Sidekick&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider these &lt;a href="http://www.roadkill.com/project-samsquanch-vinnie-barbones-drag-week-1995-geo-tracker/"&gt;cute ‘utes&lt;/a&gt; the secret kissing cousins of the more popular &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/suzuki-samurai-history-generations-models-differences/"&gt;Suzuki Samura&lt;/a&gt;i that we already suggested – and in fact, most of our Tracker suggestions came from people who had been priced out of the Samurai market when seeking a cheap trail rig. Sold in both two-door (with a soft top) and four-door editions, later (&amp;#8217;96-&amp;#8217;98) models put out just under 100 horsepower from a 1.6-liter four-cylinder motor (80 horses from &amp;#8217;89-&amp;#8217;95) and feature the same body-on-frame build with rugged low-range four-wheel drive system. Lifts are easy – and necessary when mounting larger rubber – and the Tracker gives you the Samurai footprint without paying the Samurai tax, along with super cheap parts support (you can even get a full rebuild kit for the 1.6-liter for under $250).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also sold as a Chevrolet, the Tracker was replaced by the Suzuki Vitara/Grand Vitara from 1999 to 2004. Although the Vitaras have their charms, keep in mind that they feature a less-sturdy rack-and-pinion steering setup, balanced out by the availability of a larger 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine.&lt;/p&gt;
